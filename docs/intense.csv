"Separation Anxiety at Bedtime","Bedtime","INTENSE","Hard","2-6","15","Stop crying, you're fine! I'm right in the next room. You're just trying to make me stay.","You're feeling so sad and scared when I leave. You want me to stay with you. Your heart feels lonely.","Sit on the bed, hold their hand, or offer a hug. Use a very soft, slow, loving voice. Make full, warm eye contact. Take a deep breath yourself.","Don't stand at the door. Don't sound annoyed or rushed. Don't dismiss their fear. Don't say 'You're being a baby'.","It's so hard to say goodnight, AND it's time for our bodies to rest. I'll be right here (in the next room). Would you like one 'big bear hug', or for me to sing your lullaby one more time?","Maintain physical contact (hand on shoulder, etc.). Your voice should be a 'blanket' of calm. Offer two choices focused on *comfort* and *connection*.","Don't offer 'Okay, I'll stay 10 more minutes' (this is negotiating and delays the inevitable). Don't say 'but'.","You are safe, and you are learning to sleep on your own. This is hard, and you are doing it. I am going to check on you in 5 minutes. You can hold your bear tight until I come back.","Say it with confidence and love. Give a kiss. The '5-minute check-in' promise is crucial and *must* be kept. Give them a 'job' (hold the bear).","Don't leave and *not* come back. You *must* return in 5 minutes to build trust. Don't sound like you're asking; it's a statement.","Separation anxiety is a real limbic system response. Co-regulation (your calm presence) and a predictable promise (the check-in) calms the amygdala and builds neural trust that they are safe.","You *must* do the 5-minute check-in, even if it's just poking your head in to say 'I'm here'.","It may take 1-2 weeks for them to trust the 'check-in' and feel secure.","They may still cry for the first few minutes, but the crying will de-escalate faster.","Bedtime-Nighttime Fears|Tantrums-Fatigue-Induced Meltdown"
"Nighttime Fears (Monsters)","Bedtime","INTENSE","Moderate","3-7","15","There's no monster! You're just being silly. Go to sleep!","You're feeling really scared right now. That shadow looks like a monster, and your heart is beating fast. That's a terrible feeling.","Sit on the bed *with* them. Offer a hug. Use a serious, empathetic voice. This is not a time to be playful. You must take the *fear* seriously (even if the *cause* isn't real).","Don't laugh. Don't say 'Don't be silly'. Don't turn on the main light (that's overstimulating). Don't say 'Monsters aren't real' (this invalidates the feeling).","That's a big, scary feeling, AND you are safe in your room. Let's give your brain what it needs to feel safe. Do you want me to use the 'monster spray' (water w/ lavender), or should we check under the bed with the 'courage flashlight'?","Validate the *feeling*, then shift to *safety*. The choices must be about *tools* of comfort and security that validate the emotion.","Don't offer 'Can you sleep in my bed?'. Hold the boundary of their room. Don't make the 'check' a big, noisy game (this can 'prove' there's something to check for).","Your job is to keep your room safe, and my job is to help. You are safe. Let's take three deep 'dragon breaths' together to tell your brain it's okay.","Empower them with *co-regulation* tools (breathing) and *coping* tools (spray). Reaffirm their safety.","Don't say 'See? There's nothing here'. Say 'Great, the room is safe'.","'Name it to tame it': Naming the fear (heart beating fast) engages the left-brain prefrontal cortex, which helps modulate right-brain emotional reactivity. Offering a sensory tool (lavender spray) calms the nervous system.","The fear is real to them. Your goal is to teach them how to *manage* the fear, not *debunk* the source.","They may need this routine for several nights in a row.","Be consistent. The validation of the feeling is the most important step.","Bedtime-Separation Anxiety at Bedtime|Bedtime-Over-Tired Meltdown"
"Stalling (I'm Sad the Day Is Over)","Bedtime","INTENSE","Easy","4-8","10","You're just stalling. It's time for bed. Enough!","You're feeling sad that the day is over. You had so much fun today and you don't want it to end.","Sit with them for the last book. Use a soft, nostalgic voice. Offer a hug.","Don't accuse them of 'stalling'. Don't get frustrated. Don't rush the end of the routine.","It's sad when a fun day is done, AND our bodies need rest so we can have *another* fun day tomorrow. What was your *favorite* part of today?","Validate the emotion (sadness). Connect it to the reality (rest). The 'choice' here is a *connection* question that helps them process the day.","Don't offer 'one more story'. The routine boundary is firm.","Let's close our eyes and think about (the favorite part they said). You can hold that good feeling in your heart while you sleep. You are so good at enjoying our days.","This empowers their *emotional regulation*. You are teaching them to transition from a 'big' feeling (sadness at the end) to a 'calm' feeling (gratitude for the memory).","Don't rush this part. Give them 30 seconds of silence to 'hold the feeling'.","Intense children feel 'endings' deeply. This script validates that 'transition-sadness' and reframes it as gratitude, helping the brain shift from 'emotional' to 'rest' mode.","This can become a beloved part of your bedtime routine.","They will feel heard and understood, which allows them to relax.","This helps them practice gratitude, which is a regulatory skill.","Bedtime-Over-Tired Meltdown|Transitions-Difficulty with 'Surprise'"
"Over-Tired Meltdown","Bedtime","INTENSE","Hard","2-5","20","You are overtired. Just go to sleep! Stop fighting it!","Your body is so tired it can't relax. You are sleepy and angry at the same time. That's a very frustrating feeling.","Reduce all stimuli. Turn off the main light, leave only a dim lamp. Stop talking. Just sit or lie down next to them. Give rhythmic, firm pats on their back.","Don't try to 'cheer them up'. Don't ask questions. Don't try to reason. Don't get angry. Your frustration will fuel theirs.","You're exhausted. I'm right here. Shhh. It's okay. AND I am going to stay here until your body relaxes. Do you want 'back pats' or just for me to hold your hand?","Use minimal words. Just 'calm presence'. The choice is *sensory* and *minimal*.","Don't offer 'a story' or 'music'. That's more stimulation. The goal is to *reduce* input.","You are safe. Your body knows how to sleep. I'm right here. Shhh.","Repeat a calm, monotone phrase. Your goal is to be a 'calm blanket'. You are empowering them to 'surrender' to sleep by showing them it's safe to do so.","Don't leave as soon as their eyes close. Wait 5 minutes. They are in a fragile neurological state.","When they are overtired, their sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight) is in overdrive. They can't access their parasympathetic (rest-and-digest). Your calm presence acts as an external regulator, allowing their nervous system to 'piggyback' on yours.","This is a 'meltdown', not a 'script'. It can take 20 minutes.","Your calm is the most important tool. If you are stressed, it will not work.","This is co-regulation in its purest form.","Tantrums-Fatigue-Induced Meltdown|Tantrums-Sensory Meltdown"
"Meltdown After Turn-Off","Screens","INTENSE","Hard","3-8","15","Stop this! You knew it was time! This is a ridiculous reaction!","You are so, so sad and angry that screen time is over. Your feelings are gigantic right now. You wanted to keep watching so much.","Stop everything. Sit on the floor near them. Don't say much. Just be present. Breathe deeply and visibly. Your job is to be the 'calm anchor'.","Don't try to reason. Don't threaten ('You'll never use this again!'). Don't minimize ('It's just a game!'). Don't grab them to 'contain' them.","Your feelings are huge. I see you. It's really hard to stop. AND screen time is finished. I am going to sit right here with you *while* you feel this sadness.","100% validation of the feeling. 100% firm on the boundary. The key is 'I will sit with you *while* you feel'. You are not trying to *stop* the feeling.","Don't say 'but'. Don't say 'If you stop crying, we can...'. That's a bribe.","You are safe. This big feeling will pass. Your body is angry, and that's okay. When you're ready, your body will calm down. Do you want a hug, or do you want space?","This empowers their *emotional regulation*. You are giving them permission to feel, and confidence that the feeling will pass. The 'hug or space' choice gives them sensory control.","Don't force a hug. If they scream 'space!', move back a bit and say 'Okay, I'm right here'.","Intense children have high limbic reactivity. The 'off' is a sharp dopamine drop, and their system 'crashes'. Your calm co-regulation is the only thing that can bring them back.","This can take 10-15 minutes. It cannot be rushed.","They are learning that they can survive gigantic feelings of disappointment.","When they are calm (could be 30 mins later), say 'That was a huge feeling. You got through it. Let's go get some water.'","Screens-Overstimulated by Screen|Tantrums-Disappointment Meltdown"
"Overstimulated by Screen","Screens","INTENSE","Easy","4-8","10","Stop bouncing off the walls! You're being crazy! Go to your room and calm down!","Wow! Your body is full of 'buzzy' energy! The screen put a lot of 'electricity' in you!","Use a fun, but calm, voice. Make eye contact. Act as a neutral observer of the 'energy'.","Don't blame them. Don't call them 'crazy' or 'bad'. Don't isolate them (this can be scary for an intense child).","That's a lot of stimulation, AND now we need to help your body calm down. Let's do 'heavy work'. Do you want to push the wall as hard as you can for 10 seconds, or do 20 frog jumps?","Name the feeling (stimulation). Give a *sensory solution*. 'Heavy work' (proprioception) is neurologically calming.","Don't offer 'sit and read'. Their body *needs* to move. Don't offer 'run around the house' (this builds energy).","You are in charge of calming your body. Let's go, push that wall! Show me how strong you are! You are telling your body it's time to settle.","This empowers *sensory self-regulation*. You are giving them a tool that works.","Don't do this as a punishment. Do it as a 'superhero game' to get control of your body.","Screens (especially fast-paced games) over-charge the sympathetic nervous system. Proprioceptive input (heavy work) activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the neurological 'brake'.","They will likely laugh and find it fun.","This teaches them to identify the 'buzzy' feeling and know what to do about it.","This is far more effective than a 'time out'.","Tantrums-Sensory Meltdown|Hygiene-Bath Time Resistance"
"Refusing to Turn Off (Anxiety)","Screens","INTENSE","Moderate","5-8","10","It doesn't matter if you're not 'finished'! Time is up! Give it to me!","You're feeling so frustrated because you didn't get to 'finish' the level. You really wanted to do it perfectly.","Get down to their level. Use a very empathetic voice. Name the *reason* behind the refusal (perfectionism/frustration).","Don't grab the device. Don't say 'It's just a game'. Don't minimize how important this is *to them*.","I know how frustrating it is not to finish something, AND our agreed screen time is over. It's really hard to stop in the middle. Do you want to *tell* me what you were going to do next, or do you want to *draw* the ending you wanted?","Validate the *frustration*. Hold the *boundary*. Offer a choice that helps them *process* the 'unfinished' feeling.","Don't offer 'just one more minute'. This teaches that 'not finishing' gets them more time.","You can explain the plan to me. This is hard, and you are handling a big disappointment. You are good at handling hard things.","This empowers their *emotional resilience*. You are praising the *process* (handling disappointment), not the *outcome* (winning the game).","Don't rush their explanation. Listen actively for one minute.","'Name it to tame it': By letting them talk or draw, you are moving the frustration from the emotional brain (limbic) to the thinking brain (prefrontal), which is calming.","They will feel respected and heard.","This reduces the chance of the frustration turning into a full-blown rage.","This teaches them that process matters more than perfection.","Screens-Meltdown After Turn-Off|Tantrums-Disappointment Meltdown"
"Frightened by Content","Screens","INTENSE","Moderate","3-7","15","What? That wasn't scary! That was a cartoon! Stop being silly.","Wow, that part was really scary *for you*. You weren't expecting that, and your body got a big shock.","Turn off the screen immediately. Pull them in for a hug. Speak in a soft, protective voice.","Don't say 'It was nothing'. Don't laugh. Don't force them to 'watch it again to see it's okay'. Don't shame them.","That was a big scare, AND now you are safe with me. Let's get that 'scary picture' out of your brain. Do you want to hold an ice cube (sensory shock), or should we take a deep breath and 'blow' the fear away?","Validate the *fear*. Affirm the *safety*. Offer a *sensory choice* to 'reboot' the system. A sensory shock (like ice or cold water) can break an anxious thought-loop.","Don't offer 'watch something happy'. Their brain needs a *break*, not more stimulation.","You are safe. Your body had a 'scare' reaction, and now we are helping it feel safe again. You are good at telling your body it's safe.","This empowers *interoceptive awareness* (feeling what's inside) and *self-regulation*.","Don't talk *about* the 'scary thing' more. Focus on 'safety', 'breathing', and 'now'.","Intense (HSC) children process stimuli more deeply. What is 'mild' to one child can be genuinely 'terrifying' to them. The sensory 'shock' (ice) helps 'change the channel' from the amygdala loop.","The ice cube works surprisingly well. Just holding it.","They may be fearful of screens for a bit. This is normal.","They learn they can be scared and then recover.","Bedtime-Nighttime Fears|Tantrums-Sensory Meltdown"
"Sensory Aversion (Texture)","Mealtime","INTENSE","Hard","3-8","15","Just eat it! It's just noodles! You're not leaving the table until you try it.","I see. You touched that with your fork and the texture feels 'slimy' (or 'hard'/'mushy') *to you*. Your body is saying 'yuck'.","Stay 100% neutral and calm. No disgusted face, no angry face. Just observe.","Don't force the 'one bite rule'. Don't shame them. Don't say 'But you liked it last week'. Don't make a separate meal.","I understand that texture doesn't feel good to you today, AND this is what's for dinner. You do not have to eat it. You can eat your 'safe' food [e.g., the rice and bread].","Validate the sensory aversion 100%. Hold the boundary (not making another meal). Give *permission* not to eat, while pointing to the safe options.","Don't say 'but'. Don't bargain. Don't beg.","You are in charge of your body and what goes in your mouth. You know what feels safe for you. You can just keep the 'learning food' on your plate to 'keep it company'.","This empowers *body autonomy*. For a sensory child, feeling 'forced' can cause real panic. By removing the pressure, you remove the battle. The 'keep it company' job is a food therapy technique (exposure without pressure).","Sensory aversions are neurological, not behavioral. Their brain is interpreting the texture as 'danger'. Removing the pressure is the only way to eventually build safety.","They will *not* eat the learning food tonight. The success is a peaceful meal.","This takes *months* or *years*. The goal is repeated, no-pressure exposure.","They learn that you respect their body's signals.","Mealtime-Overwhelmed by Choice|Hygiene-Toothpaste 'Too Spicy'"
"Overwhelmed by Choice","Mealtime","INTENSE","Easy","2-5","10","There's nothing to cry about! It's just food! Just pick something!","Wow, looking at all that pasta feels like 'too much'. It's a very 'full' plate and your brain doesn't know where to start.","Use a soft voice. Take their plate for a second.","Don't get frustrated at their 'paralysis'. Don't say 'Are you hungry or not?'.","That's a lot of pasta, AND I can help. Do you want me to put just a *little* bit back on your plate, or do you want me to help you get the 'magic first bite'?","Validate the 'overwhelm'. Offer a *scaffolding* choice. You're offering to help them *start*, which is the hardest part.","Don't take the food away without asking. Don't just start feeding them (this removes autonomy).","You can do this. Let's get this first bite together. You're in charge.","This empowers *task initiation*. You are being their 'external prefrontal cortex', helping them overcome the emotional paralysis.","Don't continue feeding them. Just the first bite to 'break the ice'.","Intense children can be overwhelmed by visual stimuli (a too-full plate) or too many choices. This is analysis paralysis. Helping them with the 'First Step' is an executive function strategy.","They will likely relax and start eating after the first bite.","This stops them from escalating into a full meltdown over something 'simple'.","You are co-regulating the start of the meal.","Mealtime-Sensory Aversion (Texture)|Transitions-Entering Noisy Place"
"Too Distracted by Environment","Mealtime","INTENSE","Moderate","3-6","15","Sit down! Stop looking around! Eat your food!","I notice the TV (or: the dog barking, the lights) is making it really hard for your brain to focus on food. It's very distracting.","Get down to their level. Speak softly, right into their ear.","Don't yell 'over' the distraction. Don't blame them for 'not listening'.","There's a lot going on, AND right now it's eating time. I need your help. Can you be the 'Focus Leader'? Can you show me how to 'focus on your plate' and block out the rest?","Validate the *distraction*. Hold the *boundary*. Offer a 'job' of *focus*. This is the opposite of 'don't be distracted'.","Don't say 'If you don't eat, I'm turning off the TV' (do that *before* the meal). This script is for *unexpected* distractions.","Your brain is powerful. Show me how you can tell it to focus. I'll focus with you. Let's both focus on taking three bites.","This empowers *attention* (an executive function). You're making it a partnership 'game' instead of a 'command'.","Don't expect this to last the whole meal. You may have to 'reset' the focus 2-3 times.","Intense children are more susceptible to environmental stimuli (the 'S' for 'Sensitivity to Subtleties' in DOES). The distraction isn't willful. This script helps them practice 'filtering' stimuli.","The ideal is to remove the distraction (turn off TV), but this isn't always possible (at a restaurant).","This teaches them a real-world 'mindfulness' skill.","They feel like a partner, not a problem.","Bedtime-Over-Tired Meltdown|Tantrums-Sensory Meltdown"
"Picky Eating (Emotional)","Mealtime","INTENSE","Moderate","4-8","10","This is what you ate yesterday! Stop being difficult! Just eat it!","I know you *usually* like chicken, but today your body is saying 'no'. It feels like you just want 'safe' foods right now.","Stay calm. Respect their 'no'. Remember, your job is to *offer*, theirs is to *decide*.","Don't take it personally. Don't say 'But I made this just for you!'. Don't force them.","I understand, AND this is the meal. You do not have to eat the chicken. Remember you have (rice and carrots) on your plate. You are welcome to eat those.","Validate the emotional 'no'. Hold the *boundary* (no other meal). Offer *permission* to eat only the safe parts.","Don't make a big deal about it. Don't bargain 'two bites of chicken'.","You are in charge of your plate. You decide what goes in your mouth. You are a great listener to your body.","This empowers *body autonomy* and *intuition*. You are praising them for 'listening to their body', which is a healthy life skill.","Don't praise them if they 'try it'. And don't critique them if they don't. Be neutral.","Sometimes 'picky eating' is about emotional control, not the food. Intense children use 'safe' foods (usually carbs) to feel secure when they are emotionally overwhelmed. Respecting this removes the battle.","They will eat only the rice and carrots. That is fine.","They feel safe and respected at the table.","This prevents food battles from becoming eating disorders. It's a long-term win.","Mealtime-Sensory Aversion (Texture)|Morning_Routines-Refusing Breakfast (Emotional)"

You wish you could stay all day. It feels heart-breaking.","Get down. Use a 'sad', empathetic voice. Match their tone. Offer a hug. Don't pull their arm.","Don't say 'We'll come back tomorrow' (unless it's 100% true). Don't say 'You're fine'. Don't say 'It's not a big deal'.","It's really, really hard to leave, AND our time is up. Let's say 'goodbye' to the swings. Do you want to 'hug' the slide goodbye, or do you want to hold this 'special park rock' to take home?","Validate the *sadness* (heart-breaking). Hold the *boundary*. Offer a *closing ritual* choice. This gives their brain a 'bridge' for the transition.","Don't offer '5 more minutes'. The transition *is* the problem.","You can carry that sad feeling all the way to the car. I will help you carry it. You are so good at feeling things big!","This may sound strange, but you are *praising* the *intensity* of their feeling. You are empowering them to *be* intense, rather than shaming them for it.","Don't try to 'fix' the sadness. Just *accompany* it to the car.","'Name it to tame it': By naming the emotion as 'heart-breaking sadness', you help their brain process it. The 'closing ritual' (hug slide) is an executive function tool that signals 'ending' to the brain.","They will *still* cry. But it will be a 'connected' cry (with you), not a 'fighting' cry (against you).","This is exhausting for the parent, but it's what works.","They learn that their big feelings are welcome and safe.","Transitions-Rushed Transition Meltdown|Tantrums-Disappointment Meltdown"

'I'm sorry, I'm rushing and that's stressing you out.'","Don't blame the child for your own lack of time. Don't say 'It's your fault we're late'.","I hate this rushed feeling too, AND we *do* need to leave. I need your help. Can you be the 'Shoe Boss' or the 'Door Boss'? I need a boss to help us get out.","Validate the *feeling* (rushed = anxious). Hold the *boundary* (we need to go). Offer a *power choice* to make them a *partner* in the rush, not a *victim* of it.","Don't offer a choice that takes time. 'Door Boss' (opening/closing) is quick.","You are such a good helper. Let's take one deep breath *together*, and then 'go' on turbo. You can do this.","This empowers *co-regulation* and *partnership*. You are joining *them* in the feeling ('I hate this too').","Don't expect them to move instantly. They need a second to 'gear-shift' from 'anxious' to 'helper'.","Intense children are highly sensitive to their parent's emotional state. If you are stressed, their nervous system 'short-circuits'. By naming your own stress ('I'm rushing you'), you validate them and 'clear' the neurological air.","You can prevent 90% of this by *you* getting ready 10 minutes earlier.","They feel seen, not blamed.","They may actually move faster when they feel like a 'partner'.","Transitions-Difficulty with 'Surprise'|Morning_Routines-Too Rushed/Frantic"

Give them a minute. Validate the *surprise* as a *shock*.","Don't say 'You need to learn to be flexible'. Don't drag them. Don't shame them for 'ruining the surprise'.","You're right, I should have told you. My mistake. AND we *do* need to go to the store. Do you need a minute to 'adjust your brain'?

'Adjust your brain' (giving them 60 seconds) or 'secret plan' (giving them information, which is calming).","Don't offer 'you can stay home'.","You are very good at knowing what your brain needs. When you're ready, let me know. I'll wait for 60 seconds.","This empowers *self-awareness* and *self-advocacy*. You are giving them *time* and *information*, the two antidotes to transition anxiety.","Don't be impatient during the '60 seconds'. Slowly count in your head.","Intense (HSC) children process information deeply. A sudden transition interrupts this processing and feels like a neurological 'alarm'.

You can stay here in this 'safe corner' with me until your body feels ready. You let me know.","This empowers *sensory self-regulation*. You are giving them the *agency* to decide *when* their body is ready, which paradoxically helps them feel ready faster.","Don't rush them. They may stay in the 'safe corner' for 10 minutes. That's okay.","HSCs have more reactive nervous systems. What's 'fun' to you is 'painful' to them. The 'safe corner' and 'sensory tools' are not 'coddling'; they are necessary neurological accommodations, like glasses.","They may choose to stay in the corner the whole time.
