"Won't Stay in Bed","Bedtime","DEFIANT","Moderate","3-7","10","Get back in bed right now! If I have to come in here one more time, you're losing your tablet tomorrow!","I see you're still feeling energetic and your body doesn't want to stay in bed. It's hard to lie still.","Walk calmly back to the room. Get down to eye level. Use a neutral, calm voice, not an angry one. Keep your body relaxed.","Don't yell from the hallway. Don't show frustration or anger. Don't immediately threaten. Don't make it a fun game.","You feel your body still wants to move, AND it's our job to help our bodies rest. The rule is we stay in our rooms. Do you want to lie in your bed and look at a book, or listen to one quiet song?","Keep your voice calm and firm (not mean). State the rule as 'the boss' (The rule is...). Offer two limited choices that you are okay with and that keep them in their room.","Don't say 'but'. Don't offer 'Can you just stay in bed?' (a 'no' option). Don't offer to play. Don't make the choices too exciting.","You're in charge of your choice. You pick one, and I'll help you get it set up. You know how to make good choices for your body.","Use an empowering tone. 'You're in charge...'. Step back and let them decide. Once they choose, calmly help them and leave again.","Don't hover. Don't say 'See, why was that so hard?'. Don't show impatience. Don't do it for them.","Direct commands trigger an amygdala threat response in defiant children. Offering a limited choice activates their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (decision-making), satisfying their need for autonomy while maintaining the boundary.","You may have to do this 3-5 times the first night.","They may try to negotiate for a third choice; calmly restate the two options.","Consistency is everything. After 3-4 nights, the behavior will decrease.","Bedtime-Stalling Tactics|Bedtime-Early Morning Waking"
"Stalling Tactics","Bedtime","DEFIANT","Easy","3-6","5","No, you can't have water! I'm not falling for that! It's time to sleep!","You're thinking of all the things you need before bed. You really don't want the night to end.","Get to eye level. Use an understanding, slightly playful tone, as if you're 'in' on their tactic. Smile gently.","Don't sound annoyed. Don't accuse them of 'stalling' (even if they are). Don't roll your eyes or sigh.","It's hard to say goodbye to the day, AND the bedtime routine is finished. You can have one last hug or one last sip of water. Which one will it be?","Stay calm and firm, but warm. Offer a choice of ONE last thing. Make the choices very small and specific.","Don't offer both. Don't get drawn into a negotiation for more things. Don't say 'I already gave you water'.","You chose a sip of water. Great. You're in charge of getting that sip and putting the cup back. I'll wait right here to say goodnight.","Put the power in their hands. Let them physically do the last task. This gives them agency over the final step.","Don't do it for them. Don't rush them. Don't add '...and then you better get in bed'. Just let them complete the empowered task.","This acknowledges their need for control without letting them derail the routine. Giving them agency over the *final* step ('you get the water') ends the power struggle on a cooperative note.","They will likely test this by asking for 'one more' thing after their choice. Hold the boundary.","This script works best if you anticipate the stalling and use it *before* they ask for 5 things.","They feel respected, which makes cooperation more likely.","Bedtime-Won't Stay in Bed|Morning_Routines-Dawdling and Moving Slowly"
"Nighttime Fears","Bedtime","DEFIANT","Moderate","4-8","10","There's no monster! You're just trying to get out of bed! Stop being silly and go to sleep.","It sounds like you're feeling really scared right now. It's not a fun feeling to be scared in your room.","Sit on the bed with them. Use a very soft, empathetic voice. Put a hand on their back. Make full eye contact to show you are taking them seriously.","Don't dismiss the fear. Don't laugh. Don't say 'There's nothing there' (you don't know their feeling). Don't blame them.","That's a big, scary feeling, AND you are safe in this house. We need to help your brain feel safe. Do you want to use the 'monster spray' to check under the bed, or should we turn on your special nightlight?","Validate the feeling, then state the fact (safety). The choices should be *actions* they can take to gain control over the fear. 'Monster spray' is just a water bottle.","Don't offer to let them sleep in your bed (unless that's your family rule). Don't make the check a big, scary game. Keep it boring and procedural.","You are brave and you can be in charge of this. Let's get the 'monster spray'. You show me where the 'monsters' are, and you can spray them to tell them to leave. You're the boss of your room.","Hand them the tool (spray bottle, flashlight). Let them physically perform the action. Use language like 'You're the boss' and 'You're in charge'.","Don't do it for them. Don't say 'See, there's nothing here'. Instead, say 'Great job, you've made your room safe'.","Defiant children can use fear as a control method. This script validates the feeling (connection) but empowers them with a *tool* (choice/autonomy), giving them control over the *solution* instead of control over the *parent*.","The goal is to teach them to manage the fear, not to prove the fear is 'wrong'.","They may need this routine for several nights. Be consistent.","This builds genuine self-confidence and resilience.","Bedtime-Won't Stay in Bed|Tantrums-Control-Seeking Behavior"

You must be an early bird!","Speak in a quiet, sleepy voice. Keep the lights dim. Show minimal engagement. This is about being loving but boring.","Don't turn on lights. Don't get angry. Don't start talking about the day. Don't show you're wide awake.","You're awake and that's okay, AND my body is still sleeping. The rule is that in the morning, everyone stays in their room quietly until the 'sun' on the clock turns green. You can read books in your bed, or play with these quiet-time-only toys. Your choice.","(This requires an 'Okay to Wake' clock). State the rule as 'the clock', not you. The choices must be 'quiet' and 'in your room'.","Don't offer to let them watch a screen. Don't negotiate. Don't let them come to your bed.","You're in charge of your morning. You can choose how you want to play quietly until the sun clock says it's time for everyone to be up. I know you can do it.","Point to the clock and the quiet toys. Give a quick kiss, and calmly lead them back to their room. Be loving but firm and, most importantly, *boring*.","Don't engage in a long talk. Don't stay in the room. Don't make it fun to be awake with you.","This sets a clear, external, non-negotiable boundary (the clock) instead of the parent being the 'bad guy'. Offering quiet, autonomous play choices respects their need for control while protecting the family's sleep.","You will have to lead them back to bed 10 times the first morning. Be a calm, boring robot.","This takes 1-2 weeks to stick, but it's life-changing.","The 'Okay to Wake' clock is non-negotiable for this script.","Bedtime-Won't Stay in Bed|Morning_Routines-Waking Up Grumpy"
"Refusing to Turn Off Screen","Screens","DEFIANT","Moderate","3-8","10","Turn it off NOW! I'm warning you, I'll count to three! 1... 2...","I can see you're in the middle of a really fun game. You don't want to stop. It's hard to stop when you're having fun.","Get down to eye level *before* the time is up (at the 2-minute warning). Put a hand on their shoulder. Make eye contact.","Don't yell from across the room. Don't just turn it off yourself. Don't grab it out of their hand. Don't start with a threat.","It's hard to stop, I get it. AND the timer is about to go off. That's our signal screen time is done. Do you want to push the 'off' button, or should I?","State the boundary (timer is the boss). Then, offer a choice about *how* the 'off' happens. This is a classic autonomy-granting choice.","Don't say 'but'. Don't offer 'five more minutes'. Don't get into a negotiation.","You're in charge of turning it off. You can push that button like a big kid. As soon as it's off, you can be the leader who chooses our next activity: blocks or reading?","Empower them by giving them *physical control* over the 'off' button. Then, immediately empower them again by making them the 'leader' of the *next* thing.","Don't criticize *how* they turn it off (e.g., if they slam the button). Don't say 'see, that wasn't hard'. Just move on.","The transition from high-dopamine screens is hard. Defiant children feel a loss of control. Giving them physical control over the 'off' button gives their brain an 'action' to perform, preventing the amygdala hijack.","They will still be upset. This script *reduces* the meltdown, it doesn't always prevent it.","They may refuse to choose. In that case, say 'Okay, I'll push the button this time.' Then do it calmly.","Next time, they will be more likely to choose to push it themselves.","Screens-Meltdown After Screens|Screens-Negotiating More Time|Transitions-Resisting Activity Change"

You're not getting screens tomorrow!","Wow, you are having HUGE feelings right now. You are so angry and sad that screen time is over. It's really hard.","Stop, drop, and connect. Do nothing else. Sit on the floor near them. Don't try to talk over the crying. Just be a calm, solid presence.","Don't yell. Don't threaten future screen time (punishment doesn't work). Don't lecture. Don't say 'You're fine' or 'Stop crying'.","It's okay to be angry. I'm right here. AND the screens are still off. I'm not turning them back on. When your body is calm, you can choose what we do next.","This is 'connection' + 'firm boundary'. Validate the feeling 100%. Hold the limit 100%. Don't rush them. Just sit with them.","Don't say 'If you calm down, then...'. Don't bribe them. Don't offer the screen back. Don't try to reason with them.","You're in charge of your body. You can cry as much as you need to. When you're ready, you can come sit with me, or we can build that tower. You decide when you're ready.","This is advanced. You are giving them *autonomy over their own meltdown*. You are not trying to stop it. You are empowering them to move *through* it.","Don't poke them. Don't try to force a hug. Don't keep talking. Let them have their feelings, knowing the boundary is firm.","This is a tantrum, not a negotiation. They feel out of control. Trying to 'control' them escalates it. By giving them control ('You decide when you're ready'), you remove the 'fight' from their fight-or-flight response.","This will take a long time the first few times. They are testing if you will crack. You must not.","They may scream 'I hate you!'. Stay calm. 'I hear you're angry, and I love you.'","When they calm, don't lecture. Just move on. 'You're calm now. Great. Did you want to build blocks?'","Tantrums-Long Duration Tantrums|Tantrums-Control-Seeking Behavior"
"Demanding Screen Time","Screens","DEFIANT","Easy","3-7","5","No! You're not having the iPad! You just woke up! Stop asking!","You really want to play your game right now. It's the first thing you thought of!","Kneel down, make warm eye contact. Smile. Connect with their *desire* first.","Don't start with 'No'. Don't sound annoyed. Don't list all the reasons they can't have it.","I know you love that game, AND screen time isn't on our 'morning plan'. Screen time happens this afternoon. Right now, you have a choice: do you want to be in charge of making the toast, or in charge of pouring the cereal?","Validate the desire, then state the *rule* or *plan* as the boss. Then, immediately pivot to a powerful, autonomous choice about the *current* activity.","Don't say '...but you can't'. Don't say 'Maybe later' (be specific). Don't offer a weak choice. The choice must be empowering.","You get to be the breakfast helper. Which job do you want? You're so good at both of them!","Give them a new, powerful 'job' that is more compelling than fighting for something they can't have.","Don't let them negotiate. If they say 'Neither! I want iPad!', just calmly repeat: 'iPad is for this afternoon. The choice for breakfast is toast or cereal. You decide.'","This redirects their need for autonomy away from the 'no' (screens) and toward a 'yes' (breakfast job). You are giving their brain a new, acceptable problem to solve and a way to feel in control.","They will likely ask 'Why?'. Don't get into a 'why' debate. Just restate the plan. 'That's just the plan for today.'","The choice you offer must be genuinely empowering. 'Pouring cereal' is a big-kid job.","This teaches them that the 'plan' is the boss, not you.","Morning_Routines-Waking Up Grumpy|Screens-Negotiating More Time"
"Negotiating More Time","Screens","DEFIANT","Moderate","5-8","5","I said two minutes, and that was two minutes ago! It's over! Give me that!","You are a very good negotiator! You're trying to get more time because you're having so much fun.","Use a playful, 'I see what you're doing' tone. Smile. This defuses the power struggle by naming their (admirable) strategy.","Don't get angry. Don't accuse them of 'arguing'. Don't get into a back-and-forth debate.","You're good at that! AND our deal was for 10 minutes, and the timer went off. A deal's a deal. You can be in charge of turning it off, or you can choose our next snack. Which job do you want?","Acknowledge their skill ('You're a good negotiator'). State the boundary (the 'deal' or 'timer'). Then offer two 'power' choices. One is control over the 'off', the other is control over the *next* thing.","Don't say 'But our deal was...'. Don't offer 'one more minute' (this teaches negotiation works).","You can be the 'Off' boss or the 'Snack' boss. You're in charge of the choice.","Frame the choices as powerful 'jobs'. This gives them a way to back down from the negotiation 'battle' while saving face and gaining autonomy in a new area.","Don't let them choose both. 'That's a tough choice! Pick one.'","This script respects their intelligence and their drive for control by reframing them from a 'negotiator' (a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e) to a 'boss' (empowered). It satisfies the need for control *cooperatively*.","They may still be grumpy, but they are less likely to have a full meltdown.","They may choose 'Snack boss' and then refuse to turn off the screen.

Sit and eat your own food. Model enjoyment.","Don't pressure. Don't bribe. Don't threaten. Don't make a special, separate meal. Don't force 'one bite'.","This food is here for you to eat if you want it, AND you are in charge of your own body. You don't have to eat it. You can eat your 'safe' food [e.g., the rice and bread].","This is Ellyn Satter's Division of Responsibility. State the boundary: parent provides, child decides. Validate their *right* to refuse. (Assuming there is at least one 'safe' food on the plate).","Don't say 'But you liked it last week'. Don't sigh. Don't try to 'sell' the food.","You're in charge of what goes in your mouth. This chicken is delicious, and I'll put it on the table again another day. Maybe your body will be ready then.","This gives them 100% autonomy, which is the *only* way to win a food battle with a defiant child. You are giving them *full permission* to not eat it.","Don't offer an alternative meal. 'Dinner is what's on the table. You can eat the parts you like.'","Food is a prime area for control battles. This script removes the *battle*. By giving them full autonomy, the food is no-longer a weapon. Their need for control is met, so they may *eventually* try it.","This is a long-term strategy. They will not eat the new food tonight. That is the point.","The goal is a peaceful meal, not a 'won' battle.","They may complain 'I'm hungry' after dinner. Calmly say 'I hear you.

Just observe. Keep eating your own meal.","Don't engage in a power struggle. Don't beg. Don't threaten. Don't become a short-order cook.","That's a tough feeling, AND dinner is what we're having. You are in charge of your body, and you can choose not to eat. Dinner will be over in 10 minutes when the timer goes off.","Validate their 'no'. Re-state the boundary (this is dinner). Then, give them *full autonomy* over their choice, *including* the natural consequence.","Don't say 'But you have to eat'. Don't offer a different meal. Don't try to coax 'just one bite'.","You're the boss of your belly. If your belly says 'no', you can listen to it. The kitchen will be closed after dinner, and we'll have breakfast in the morning. Your choice.","Empower them as the 'boss' of their own body. State the natural consequence (kitchen closed) in a neutral, non-threatening way.","Don't state the consequence as a threat ('...and you'll be hungry!'). Just state it as a fact.","This is the ultimate 'autonomy' script. It takes the 'fight' completely out of the situation. A defiant child who has nothing to push against has no battle to win. They will test this.","They will absolutely get up from the table, not eat, and then 30 minutes later say 'I'm hungry'.","You must *calmly* say, 'I hear you. You chose not to eat dinner.

Don't start a lecture about manners.","You're ready to play! That's great. AND the rule in our family is we sit together until the timer goes off. You can sit in your chair, or you can sit on my lap. What's your choice?","Validate their desire, state the 'family rule' (the boss), and offer two choices that both meet the rule.","Don't let them get down and play. Don't offer a 'no' option.","You're in charge. My lap, or your chair? You decide where your body sits for 5 more minutes.","Frame them as 'in charge' of *where* they sit, which respects their autonomy, while you maintain the boundary of *that* they sit.","Don't make the time too long. 5-10 minutes of 'sit time' is realistic for a preschooler. Use a visual timer.","This script gives them a feeling of control in a situation where they have very little.","They may choose your lap for 2 nights and then decide their chair is more comfortable. Both are wins.","If they refuse, calmly say 'It looks like you're having a hard time choosing, so I'll choose. You can sit on my lap.'

Your hands are for eating or your fork is for eating. You choose.","Validate the *interest* (squishing is fun). State the *rule* (food is for eating). Offer a choice about *how* to eat.","Don't say 'but'. Don't say 'That's gross'.","If you're all done eating and just want to play, that's okay too. You can say 'all done' and you can be in charge of putting your plate in the sink. What's your choice: eat or all done?","This is the key. Give them two clear, empowered choices. 'Eat' (with fork or hands) or 'Be All Done' (and gain the power of clearing their own plate).","Don't force them to eat. If they choose 'all done', the meal is over. No snacks 10 minutes later.","This script identifies the *real* choice: are you eating or are you done? A defiant child wants control. This gives it to them. 'I'm not a baby, I'm the boss of my plate.'","If they keep playing after the warning, calmly say, 'I see you chose 'all done'.' and take the plate.","This respects their exploration but holds the boundary that mealtimes are for eating.","Mealtime-Food Battles|Mealtime-Refusing New Foods"

This shifts their brain from 'loss of control' (leaving) to 'gaining control' (choosing the game).","Don't offer a choice you can't live with ('Do you want to race?' - they may run away). 'Ninja' and 'T-Rex' are both 'walking with parent'.","They will still be sad, but this massively reduces the chance of a full-blown tantrum.","They may refuse to choose.

Instead of being the 'rule-breaker', they are the 'rule-rememberer'. This gives them a powerful, autonomous job.","Don't make the secret signal a shaming thing. Make it a fun, 'we're a team' thing.","This 'pre-loading' of the rule, combined with giving them an empowered 'job', sets them up for success.

Just match their energy (calmly).","Don't be overly cheerful. Don't start ripping open curtains. Don't start listing all the things they have to do.","It's okay to feel grumpy. I get that. AND the day has to start. The rule is school/daycare. You're in charge of how we start. Do you want 5 more minutes of 'cozy time' and then we get up, or do you want to get up now and race me to the kitchen?","Validate the 'grumpy' 100%. State the boundary (day is starting). Offer a choice: 'more control over *time*' (5 more mins) or 'control over *activity*' (a race).","Don't offer 'stay in bed' as an option. Don't get annoyed by the grumpiness.","You decide. You're the boss of your morning. 5 more minutes, or race?","This gives them power right at the moment they feel powerless. They get to control the *pace* of the morning's start, which is huge for a defiant child.","Don't let '5 more minutes' turn into 15. Use a timer. 'Okay, 5 minutes of cozy time starts now! You're in charge of the timer!'","They may just grunt. 'Okay, I'll set the timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, you'll be in charge of getting dressed.'","This respects their feelings while holding the boundary of the routine.","Morning_Routines-Refusing to Get Dressed|Bedtime-Early Morning Waking"
"Won't Eat Breakfast","Morning_Routines","DEFIANT","Moderate","4-8","5","Fine! Don't eat! But don't come asking me for a snack in 10 minutes!","You're looking at your breakfast and your body is saying 'no thank you'. That's okay.","This is just like the 'Mealtime' scripts. Stay neutral. Don't beg or plead. It's a busy morning, but this is a battle you can't win with force.","Don't force. Don't bribe. Don't threaten. Don't get into a 10-minute negotiation.","I know you're not feeling it, AND this is the food we have for breakfast. You're in charge of your body, so you can choose to eat or choose not to eat. School starts soon, and the next time to eat is snack time. Your choice.","State the boundary (this is breakfast). Give them full autonomy (your choice). State the natural consequence *neutrally* (next eating time is snack).","Don't say '...and you'll be starving!'. Don't make a 'to-go' breakfast they can eat in the car (this teaches them they can win the negotiation).","You're the boss of your belly. You decide. We're leaving in 10 minutes.","This takes the power struggle out. You are not *making* them eat. You are *offering* them food. They are choosing. A defiant child needs this choice.","They will 100% choose not to eat at least once.","They will be hungry. When they get home, they will eat a huge lunch. They will learn the natural consequence.","This is *much* faster and less stressful than the 20-minute 'eat your food' battle.","Mealtime-Food Battles|Morning_Routines-Dawdling and Moving Slowly"

You're showing me you don't want to go.","Use a neutral, observational tone. You're just a scientist noticing the speed. Don't get angry.","Don't yell. Don't join their chaotic/slow energy. Don't take it personally ('doing this to me'). Don't do it for them.","It's hard to rush, AND we do have to leave. The clock says 8:15. You are the 'shoe boss' and I'm the 'bag boss'. I'll race you. I bet I can get the bags before you can get your shoes on. Go!","Validate their feeling (don't want to go). State the boundary (the clock). Then, turn it into an *autonomous challenge*. You're not 'bossing' them; you're *challenging* them.","Don't make it a 'me vs. you' fight. Make it a 'you vs. the task' game.","You're in charge of your shoes. I'm in charge of my bags. Let's see which boss is faster. Ready, set, go!","This frames them as a 'boss' and gives them a *target* (beating you). This redirects their 'no' energy into 'challenge' energy.","Don't get mad if they 'lose'. 'Wow, the bags were fast today! Let's see if the 'shoe boss' can finish up.'","This turns a passive-aggressive power struggle into a cooperative game where they still get to feel powerful.","This works best if you make it fun. 'Oh, you're too slow, I'm gonna win!' in a playful, taunting way.","Be prepared to leave if they don't. 'Okay, I'm at the door. I'm leaving in 10 seconds.' (Then walk out.

They're so comfy and you don't want to start the day.","Sit on the bed with them. Use a warm, empathetic tone. Touch their shoulder.","Don't stand in the doorway tapping your foot. Don't list all the things you have to do. Don't start the day with anger.","I know, PJs are the best. AND it's a school day, and clothes are on the plan. I've got your two favorite shirts here. Do you want to wear the 'Space' shirt or the 'Dino' shirt?","Validate their desire. State the 'plan' (the boss). Offer a limited, powerful choice. (This assumes you laid out the two shirts the night before).","Don't offer 'What do you want to wear?' (too many choices). Don't ask 'Can you get dressed?' (a 'no' option).","You're the boss of your outfit. You pick. You can also decide what to put on first: your super-fast shirt or your jumping pants?","Give them as many layers of choice as possible. 'You pick the shirt'. 'You pick what goes on first'. This showers them with autonomy.","Don't get drawn into a battle if they say 'Neither!'. Calmly say, 'Looks like you're having trouble choosing. You've got 30 seconds to pick, or I'll pick for you.' (This is an advanced, but effective, boundary).","This satisfies their need for control 100%. They are the 'boss' of the entire process. This redirects their 'no' energy into 'choice' energy.","This requires 5 extra minutes in the schedule. It is *faster* than the 20-minute battle.","They may still move slowly. Use a visual timer.

"Long Duration Tantrums","Tantrums","DEFIANT","Hard","4-8","20","You're done. Stop it. This is ridiculous. If you don't stop, you're going to your room!","You are having a giant, powerful tantrum. Your body is full of 'NO!' right now. You are so, so angry.","Stay calm. This is the #1 rule. Sit nearby, but not too close. Be a 'calm anchor'. Don't talk much. Just be present.","Don't try to stop it. Don't threaten. Don't bribe. Don't reason. Don't punish. Don't try to 'win'. Don't leave them alone (unless you're unsafe).","It is okay to be this angry. I am right here with you, and I am keeping you safe. AND I am not changing my mind (about the toy/screen/etc).","Validate the feeling 100%. State the boundary 100%. 'I am here' (safety) + 'I'm not changing my mind' (firmness).","Don't say 'but'. Don't say 'If you calm down...'. Don't say 'This is an ugly way to act'.","You are in charge of your body. You can be as angry as you need to be. I'll be right here to make sure you're safe. When you're ready for a hug, I'm here.","This is the ultimate empowerment. You are giving them *autonomy over their own emotions*. You are not trying to *stop* the tantrum; you are *allowing* it, while holding the boundary.","Don't try to force a hug. Don't keep talking. Silence is powerful. Just sit and be calm.","A defiant child's long tantrum is a test of will. They are testing if you will crack. By staying calm and validating their feeling, you remove the 'fight'. You are not fighting them. You are just 'being'.","This will feel like the hardest thing you ever do. It will take 20-30 minutes the first time.","When they finally calm down, don't lecture. Just offer a hug. 'That was a big feeling. You're calm now. Let's get some water.'","Tantrums-Control-Seeking Behavior|Tantrums-Public Tantrum"
"Control-Seeking Behavior (The 'NO!' Tantrum)","Tantrums","DEFIANT","Moderate","3-6","10","Stop saying no! You can't just say 'no' to everything!","You are using a very powerful 'NO!' word today. You're showing me you want to be in charge.","Get down to eye level. Smile slightly, with a 'you're a tough customer' look. Acknowledge their power.","Don't get into a 'Yes!'-'No!' battle. Don't get angry. Don't take it personally.","That 'no' is strong! I get it. AND it's time to (go/eat/etc). You have two choices. You can say 'No!' and *do it*, or you can say 'Yes!' and *do it*. Which kind of 'no' will it be?","This is a "jiu-jitsu" move. You are *agreeing* with their 'no' but reframing it. 'You can say 'no' all you want, but you still have to do the thing.' You are giving them a choice over their *words*, not the *action*.","Don't say 'You have to say yes'.","You are in charge of your words. You can say 'NO, I'm putting my shoes on!' or 'NO, I'm getting in the car!'. You choose.","This is a game-changer. You are giving them *full permission* to be defiant *while co-operating*. This satisfies both needs at once.","Don't be surprised when they yell 'NO, I'M NOT PUTTING MY SHOES ON!' while... putting their shoes on. This is a *win*.","This script works by separating the *feeling* of defiance (saying 'no') from the *action* of co-operation. It respects their need for autonomy in a creative way.","This only works for low-stakes 'no' battles, not major safety issues.","It turns a power struggle into a silly game, and they are in on the joke.","Tantrums-Long Duration Tantrums|Transitions-Won't Get in Car Seat"
"Public Tantrum","Tantrums","DEFIANT","Hard","3-7","15","Stop it! Everyone is looking at us! You are embarrassing me! Get up!","You are so angry that I said 'no' to the toy. You're on the floor and your body is full of mad.","Stop. Take a breath. Your #1 job is to ignore the 'stares'. Get down on the floor *with them*. Speak in a low, calm voice.","Don't yell. Don't give in and buy the toy. Don't threaten. Don't shame them ('everyone is looking').","I know you're mad. It's okay to be mad. AND the answer is still 'no'. We are going to (stay here until you're calm / go to the car). Do you want to walk to the car, or do you want me to carry you?","Validate the feeling. Hold the boundary. Then offer a choice for the *next action*. (Note: 'carrying' a flailing child is hard. 'Walk or I carry' is a last resort).","Don't offer 'stay here until you're calm' if you're in a high-traffic aisle. The best bet is 'car'.","You're in charge of your body. You can walk, or I will help you by carrying you. You decide.","Give them 10 seconds to decide. This gives them a 'power' choice in a moment of public powerlessness.","Don't negotiate. Don't keep talking.","If they don't choose, calmly say 'You're having a hard time choosing, so I will help you.' Pick them up (as safely as possible) and walk to the car. Do not talk. Do not lecture.","Once in the car, just wait. Let them finish. Then (and only then) talk. 'That was hard. You were mad. We're calm now.'","This is about safety and boundary-holding. The 'choice' gives them a chance to co-operate and save face, but you must be prepared to follow through.","Tantrums-Long Duration Tantrums|Transitions-Resisting Activity Change"
"Aggressive Tantrum (Hitting/Kicking)","Tantrums","DEFIANT","Hard","3-8","15","Stop hitting me! What is wrong with you? Only bad kids hit!","You are SO angry your body is hitting. I am not going to let you hit me.","This is a safety-first script. Your tone is 100% firm, but not angry. Block the hit (with your arm, a pillow, etc.). Create space.","Don't hit back. Don't scream. Don't shame them ('bad kid'). Don't get in their face.","It is okay to be angry, AND it is *not* okay to hit. I'm moving my body to keep it safe. You can hit this pillow, or you can stomp your feet. Which one?","Firm, clear boundary. 'Okay to be angry, NOT okay to hit'. Then, *immediately* offer a choice of two *safe* ways to get the aggression out.","Don't say 'Don't hit'. Say 'I won't let you hit'. It's a statement of *your* boundary.","You are in charge of your body. You choose. Pillow or feet? Show me how hard you can stomp.","Redirect the *action*, don't just stop it. The energy has to go somewhere. Empower them to be in charge of *where* it goes.","Don't try to hug them or restrain them (unless they are a danger to themselves or others). Restraint can escalate aggression.","This separates the *feeling* (anger, which is okay) from the *action* (hitting, which is not). A defiant child needs to know *what they CAN do*.","You must be a 'calm wall'. They will feed off your anger. Stay neutral.","If they try to hit you again, move away.

Don't shame ('Be nice'). Don't threaten to leave. This teaches that sharing is a *punishment*.","It's your truck, AND your friend really wants to play, too. We don't have to 'share', but we do 'take turns'. You're in charge. Do you want to give him a turn in 2 minutes, or 3 minutes? You set the timer.","Reframe 'sharing' (which feels like losing) to 'taking turns' (which implies you get it back). Then, give them *all* the power. They choose the *time*. They *set the timer*.","Don't offer 'or you can play together'. The choice must be about the *turn*.","You are the 'Timer Boss'. You decide: 2 minutes or 3? When the timer goes off, it's his turn. Then, *you* get to be in charge of the timer for *his* turn.","This gives them so much autonomy (choosing time, setting timer, being the 'boss') that it overrides the 'loss' of the toy.","Don't be surprised if they choose '2 minutes'. They just want the control.","This script teaches that 'taking turns' is a *powerful*, high-status job, not a punishment.","(Note: If it's a 'special' toy, it's okay to say 'This is your special truck. We'll put it away so no one has to share it, and you can be in charge of picking a 'taking-turns' toy.')","Social-Taking Turns|Tantrums-Control-Seeking Behavior"

Don't just pull them off.","It's so fun, AND the rule of the playground is 'we take turns'. You are in charge of your turn. Do you want to ride it two more times to the fence, or one more 'fast' time? You choose your 'last run'.","State the 'playground rule' (external boss). Then, empower them to be in charge of *how their turn ends*.","Don't ask 'Are you ready to be done?' (they'll say no).","You decide your 'last run'. You're the boss of this turn. When you're done, you can be the boss of counting for your friend's turn.","This gives them autonomy over the *end* of their turn, which makes the 'end' feel like a *choice*. Then, it gives them a *new* power-job (counting for the friend).","Don't rush their 'last run'. Let them have it.","This script avoids the 'loss of control' that triggers the defiant amygdala. They are not *losing* their turn; they are *choosing* to finish it.","They will feel respected and are more likely to hand it over willingly.","When the friend is done, they'll be eager to be 'in charge' of their turn again.","Social-Won't Share Toys|Social-Following Group Rules"
"Interrupting Adults","Social","DEFIANT","Easy","5-8","5","Stop interrupting! It's rude! Wait your turn!","You have something so important to say! You really want me to hear it right now!","(This is a 'teaching' script, not a 'in the moment' one). Do this at a calm time.","Don't shame them ('rude') in front of the person they interrupted. This backfires.","It's so exciting, AND it's hard for my brain to listen to two people at once. I want to hear your idea. We need a 'power' signal. What's our secret sign that you're in charge of, to let me know you need to talk?","Validate their *need* (it's important). State the *problem* (my brain). Then, invite them to *create* the solution. This is Collaborative Problem Solving (Ross Greene).","Don't just give them a rule. Let them *invent* the rule with you.","Should you put your hand on my arm? Or squeeze my hand? You decide what the 'I need to talk' signal is. When I feel it, I'll give you a squeeze back to let you know 'I see you'.","This gives them a powerful, physical, *autonomous* tool to use. They are not 'interrupting'; they are 'using the secret signal'. They are *in charge* of it.","Don't make the signal 'say excuse me' - that's just another rule. Make it a *physical, secret* signal.","This works because it gives their 'control' need a *job*. Their job is to 'use the signal'. Your job is to 'acknowledge it'.","When they use it, you *must* acknowledge it (a hand squeeze back). Then, finish your sentence and turn to them. 'Okay, I saw your signal. You're the boss. What's up?'","This respects them and teaches them a skill that will last a lifetime.","Social-Following Group Rules|Tantrums-Control-Seeking Behavior"
"Following Group Rules","Social","DEFIANT","Moderate","4-7","5","Why can't you just listen like the other kids? Sit down!","I see you're having a hard time at circle time.

Do you want to sit on this 'power' cushion, or do you want to be the 'helper' who holds the book for the teacher?","Acknowledge the difficulty. State the 'rule'. Offer two powerful, autonomous choices. 'Power cushion' (a wiggle seat) or 'Helper' (a high-status job).","Don't offer 'do you want to sit or not?'. The choice is *how* they sit.","You're in charge. You can be the 'book boss' or the 'cushion boss'. You decide.","This gives them a *role* in the group that is *more powerful* than 'rule-breaker'. 'Helper' or 'Book Boss' is a high-status, autonomous job that defiant children crave.","Don't make the job a 'punishment'. It must be a *real* job.","This reframes their 'defiance' energy into 'leadership' energy. They get to feel in control *while* following the group rule.","This requires co-operation from the 'group leader' (teacher).","This strategy prevents the amygdala hijack by giving the prefrontal cortex a 'job'.","Social-Taking Turns|Transitions-Following Rules at Others' Homes"

Don't threaten (they don't believe you). Don't 'pin them down'. This is a battle you will lose.","I hear your 'no', AND the 'sugar bugs' have to go. The rule is we brush. You're the boss. Do you want to brush *my* teeth first, and then *your* teeth? Or should we brush your teddy bear's teeth first?","Validate, state the 'rule' (sugar bugs = boss), and then offer two *silly, powerful* choices. Letting them 'brush your teeth' is a huge power-flip.","Don't offer 'or should I do it?'. The choices must be 'you do it (in a silly way)'.","You're in charge of the brush. Who's first? Me or Teddy? You decide.","This turns a 'me vs. you' battle into a 'us vs. the sugar bugs' game. And by giving them the brush to use on *you*, you give them 100% of the power, which makes them *want* to do it.","Be prepared to have your teeth awkwardly brushed for 10 seconds.","They will be so excited to be 'the boss' of brushing *you* that they will forget they are 'defying'.","After they brush your teeth, say 'My turn!

AND it's bath time. You're in charge of the 'fun'. Do you want to put 'bath bombs' in, or should we use the 'magic' (color-changing) bubbles? You choose the mission.","Validate, state the boundary (bath time), and offer a choice that gives them *control over the bath itself*. 'Bath bombs' and 'bubbles' are exciting.","Don't offer 'do you want a bath?'. The choice is *how* the bath happens.","You're the boss of the bath. You choose: bombs or bubbles? You can also be in charge of testing the water.","Give them *jobs*. 'Bath bomb boss'. 'Water tester'. These are powerful, autonomous roles.","Don't offer choices you don't have. (If you don't have bath bombs, don't offer them). 'Crayons or bubbles?' works too.","This gives their brain a 'yes' (I get to be the boss of bubbles) which is stronger than their 'no' (I don't want a bath).","This pre-empts the battle. The 'fun' choice makes them *want* to get in.","They get to control the *experience*, so you get to control the *boundary* (getting in).","Hygiene-Won't Brush Teeth|Transitions-Resisting Activity Change"

You can brush your own hair, or you can be in charge of the spray and tell me where to brush. You decide.","This gives them 100% control. They can do it themselves (and will be gentler), or they can 'boss' you around ('a little lower... okay stop!'). Both satisfy the need for autonomy.","Don't expect a perfect job if they do it themselves. The goal is 'no battle', not 'perfect hair'.","This reframes the entire event from a 'fight' to a 'co-operative mission' where *they are the boss*.","This may take twice as long.
