I see you're playing with the car. You forgot what's next, didn't you?","Walk over to them. Get to eye level and use a gentle, physical touch to get their attention. Use a kind, knowing tone. Not angry.","Don't yell from the doorway. Don't assume they are defying you. Don't list all the steps they forgot.","That's okay! It's a lot to remember. AND it's bedtime. Let's look at our chart. What's the *first* step?","Point to a visual schedule (e.g., a chart with pictures). Speak slowly. Focus only on *one* step.","Don't say 'but'. Don't overwhelm them with the *whole* list. Don't show frustration that they forgot.","'PJs'! You got it. You are in charge of that one step. Go put your PJs on, and then come and show me. I'll tell you the next step.","Give them *one single task*. Make 'coming back to you' the end of that task. This provides the external structure they need.","Don't give the next step yet. Don't expect them to remember 'PJs *and* teeth'. Just 'PJs'.","A distracted child's working memory is limited. They aren't defiant; they're overloaded. Giving one instruction at a time prevents cognitive overload and 'task-dropping'.","You will have to guide them, step by step, through the entire routine.","This is not babying them; it's providing essential executive function support.","Visual charts are not a 'nice-to-have'; they are critical external memory aids.","Bedtime-Gets Up Repeatedly|Morning_Routines-Forgetting Items"
"Gets Up Repeatedly","Bedtime","DISTRACTED","Moderate","4-8","10","If you get out of that bed one more time, I'm taking away the iPad tomorrow!","[Calmly walk them back. No emotion]. Hi again. I need your eyes. You're out of bed.","Be a calm, boring 'robot'. No anger, no fun, no frustration. Gently take their hand.","Don't show emotion. Don't get into a conversation. Don't make it a fun game.","It's easy to forget the rule when your brain thinks of something fun, AND the rule is 'stay in bed'. What's the rule?","Keep it simple. 'The rule is...' State it clearly. Have them repeat it.","Don't ask 'Why did you get up?'. This invites a long, distracting conversation.","Right, 'stay in bed'. You're in charge of your body. Let's get it back under the covers. I'll see you in the morning.","Lead them back, make them get in. Quick, boring, loving pat. Leave. Repeat as many times as needed.","Don't tuck them in again, read another story, or give extra hugs. This *must* be boring.","This is an impulse-control and working memory issue, not defiance. They forget the 'staying in' part. A boring, robotic response makes it neurologically 'unrewarding' to get up.","You may have to do this 10 times the first night. Consistency is the only thing that works.","They aren't doing it to make you mad; their impulse control is 'offline' at night.","This script is about 'doing', not 'talking'.","Bedtime-Forgot Bedtime Steps|Transitions-Impulsively Runs Off"
"Distracted During Story","Bedtime","DISTRACTED","Easy","3-6","5","Sit still! If you can't be calm for a story, then no story!","I see your body is very 'wiggly' right now. It's hard to be still and listen at the same time.","Pause the story. Use a gentle, observant tone. Put your hand on their arm.","Don't threaten to take the story away (a beloved connection point). Don't sound angry.","Your body has 'wiggles', AND it's story time. Let's give those wiggles a job. Do you want to squeeze this 'fidget' or wear the 'heavy' (weighted) lap pad?","Validate the 'wiggles'. Offer a *sensory* choice that *helps* focus, rather than punishing the lack of it.","Don't just say 'Stop wiggling'. Don't offer a 'toy' (that's another distraction).","You're in charge of your wiggles. Let's see if that heavy pad helps your body settle. Show me. Okay, back to the story.","Empower them by giving them a *tool* to manage their distraction. You're making them an active participant in their own regulation.","Don't expect perfect stillness. The goal is 'less' wiggling, not 'no' wiggling.","Distracted children often need *more* sensory input (proprioception, tactile) to free up their *auditory* processing. A fidget or weighted pad provides this, 'grounding' their brain.","A 'wiggle' is often the brain's attempt to self-regulate. Your job is to make that attempt 'productive'.","This teaches them a lifelong skill of using sensory tools to focus.","Social-Interrupting (Impulsive)|Tantrums-Hyperactive/Restless"
"Can't Settle Down (Hyperfocus)","Bedtime","DISTRACTED","Moderate","5-8","10","It's 8:30! You were supposed to be in bed 30 minutes ago! Why are you still playing Legos?","[Gently touch shoulder]. Hey. I need to 'pause' your brain. [Wait for eye contact]. You are *deep* in the Lego 'zone'. You didn't hear me at all.","Get in their physical space (kindly).

Don't assume they ignored you (they 100% did not hear you).","That focus is an amazing superpower, AND the timer for bedtime went off. (Point to a *visual* timer). It's time to stop. Your *one* job: find a 'stopping point' in the next 60 seconds.","Validate the hyperfocus as a *strength* ('superpower'). State the *visual* boundary (timer). Give a *one-step* command ('find a stopping point').","Don't just say 'Stop now'. That's neurologically jarring. Don't just turn off the light.","You're in charge of the 'pause' button. Show me where you'll stop. [Wait]. Great. Now, stand up. That's Step 1. Come with me for Step 2.","Empower them to control *how* they stop. Then, physically guide them to the *next* single step (stand up, walk with me).","Don't assume they know what 'get ready for bed' means. You must guide them.","Hyperfocus is the flip side of distractibility. The brain gets 'stuck'. A verbal command can't get in. A physical touch and a visual timer are needed to break the 'trance'.","They will likely be disoriented. Be gentle and guide them one step at a time.","Using a 'blinking' light timer in addition to an audio one is highly effective.","Transitions-Resisting Activity Change|Screens-Won't Turn Off (Forgot)"

Don't assume they're being defiant.","You're loving that game, AND the timer is done. (Point to a *visual* timer, like a TimeTimer). It's time for Step 1: Pause. You're in charge of the pause button.","Validate the focus. State the *visual* boundary. Give a *micro-step* ('pause').","Don't say 'Turn it off'. That's too big. 'Pause' is the first, achievable step.","Great! Step 1 is done. You're in charge of Step 2: The 'off' button. Show me. [Wait]. Perfect. Now, what's our *next* activity? (Point to visual schedule).","Empower them by breaking 'turn it off' into two separate steps. Then immediately point them to the *next* concrete thing on the schedule.","Don't walk away after 'pause'. They will 'forget' Step 2. Stay there.","They genuinely do not hear you. Their brain is filtering you out. You must use physical proximity and a visual cue (the timer) to break through.","The two-step 'pause' then 'off' gives their brain a moment to transition, preventing a 'crash'.","A visual timer they can see *while playing* is the most important tool.","Screens-Meltdown (Overstimulated)|Transitions-Resisting Activity Change"
"Meltdown (Overstimulated)","Screens","DISTRACTED","Moderate","3-7","10","Stop this! You're acting crazy. If you can't handle it, no more screens ever!","Whoa! Your body is full of 'static electricity' from the screen. It's 'buzzy' and out of control. Your brain is going too fast!","Use a strong, clear voice (not angry). Name the *physical* feeling ('buzzy', 'static').","Don't say 'Stop crying'. Don't threaten. Don't try to reason. Don't blame them.","That's a 'too-much' feeling, AND we need to get that energy out. Let's do a 'brain reset'. Your job is one thing: 10 wall push-ups. Ready?","Validate the *physical* overwhelm. Give a *single* command that is *physical*.","Don't offer a 'calm' activity (like reading). The body *needs* to move to regulate.","Go! Push that 'buzzy' feeling into the wall. You're in charge of resetting your brain. [Count with them]. Great! Next step: a cold drink of water.","Empower them with a *physical tool*. Proprioceptive input (wall push-ups, stomping) is neurologically calming and 'resets' a 'scrambled' nervous system.","Don't talk *about* the meltdown. Just give the physical, step-by-step instructions.","Screen transitions are neurologically difficult. A 'distracted' brain needs a physical, sensory 'off-ramp' to transition from high-stim to low-stim. This is a tool, not a punishment.","They will likely do it and feel better, but be confused. That's okay.","It's a physical 'reboot'. It works.","Tantrums-Hyperactive/Restless|Transitions-Impulsively Runs Off"
"Keeps Asking for Screens","Screens","DISTRACTED","Easy","4-8","5","How many times do I have to tell you? No! Stop asking me!","Hey, I need your eyes. You're asking for the tablet again. You're having a hard time remembering the 'no'.","Get eye contact. Be kind but firm. Acknowledge the *forgetting*.","Don't get angry. Don't say 'Stop asking'. Don't just keep repeating 'no' verbally.","It's hard to hold the 'plan' in your head, AND the answer is still 'at 4 PM'. Let's make a 'brain helper'. Your job: let's draw the clock at 4 PM and tape it to the fridge.","Validate the *working memory* challenge. State the boundary. Offer a *visual tool* as the solution.","Don't say 'Maybe later'. Be concrete.","You're in charge of this picture. If your brain forgets, you can go look at your 'boss picture' to remember. Now, what's the *real* next thing on our plan? (Point to visual schedule).","Empower them by making *them* the creator of their own 'external memory'. This visual cue now exists in the world, freeing up their working memory.","Don't just make the drawing *for* them. The *act* of making it helps their brain.","A verbal 'no' is invisible and gets 'lost' in a distracted brain. A *visual* 'no' (or 'yes, at 4') is permanent and provides the external structure they need.","When they ask again, don't say 'no'. Say 'Go check the 'boss picture'!'","This teaches them to use visual aids, a critical life skill for them.","Morning_Routines-Forgetting Items|Transitions-Forgets Instructions"

,"This is a 100% physical-presence-and-touch script. Do not speak until you have their attention.","Don't yell from another room. It will never work. Don't be surprised they didn't 'listen'.","You 100% did not hear me call for dinner, did you? That's okay. You were in the 'zone'. AND dinner is on the table. We need to do the 2 'off' steps. Step 1: Pause.","Be empathetic, not angry. 'You didn't hear me' (fact) vs. 'You ignored me' (accusation). Break the 'off' task into two steps.","Don't give the multi-step command: 'Turn it off, wash your hands, and come to the table.' This is a 100% guaranteed failure.","Great. Step 2: Power button. [Wait]. Awesome. Now, *one* next step: walk to the kitchen sink. I'll walk with you.","Give *one* instruction at a time. Walk *with* them to the next 'station' (sink). This is 'scaffolding'.","Don't expect them to complete the sequence alone. They will get sidetracked.","A distracted child's brain *cannot* process a verbal command from another room while engaged in a high-stimulus activity. Proximity and single-step instructions are the only way.","At the sink, you'll give the *next* one-step command: 'Your job: wash hands.'","This feels slow, but it's 100x faster than the 10-minute yelling match.","Mealtime-Too Distracted to Eat|Transitions-Forgets Instructions"
"Too Distracted to Eat","Mealtime","DISTRACTED","Easy","3-7","10","Sit still. Stop looking at the dog. Eat your food. Stop wiggling.","Hey, I need your eyes on me. [Wait]. Your brain is noticing *everything* in the room *except* your food! Your eyes are all over.","Get their attention. Use a gentle, playful 'I see you' tone.","Don't just give a list of 'stop' commands. Don't get frustrated.","It's hard to focus when so much is happening, AND it's time to eat. Let's get your 'Focuser' on. Your job: take *one* 'super-bite' right now.

Now, your next job: let's see if you can take *two* more bites before this 1-minute sand timer runs out. You're in charge of racing the timer.","Empower them by 'gamifying' the focus. A visual sand timer provides a concrete, external focus point. You're breaking the meal into 1-minute 'sprints'.","Don't expect 20 minutes of focus. Expect 1-2 minutes, then reset.","They are not being defiant; their brain is genuinely pulled by other stimuli. Breaking it down into 'one bite' and using a visual timer provides the external structure to support focus.","This is a 'task-initiation' problem. The first bite is the hardest.","You may need to use the timer 3-4 times during the meal.","Mealtime-Gets Up from Table|Screens-Distracted By Screen"
"Forgets to Eat (Playing with Food)","Mealtime","DISTRACTED","Moderate","2-5","5","Stop playing! Food is for eating! You're making a mess!","[Gentle touch on hand]. Hey buddy. Your hands are busy building a 'potato mountain', but your mouth isn't! You forgot what you were doing.","Use a kind, observational tone. Gently stop the hand that is 'playing'.","Don't get angry. Don't shame the 'playing' (it's often just their brain 'drifting').","Potato mountains are cool, AND dinner is for eating. Let's get back on track. What's the *first* step to eating? (e.g., 'fork').","Validate the 'drift'. State the boundary. Then ask a 'Step 1' question.","Don't just say 'Eat!'","Right! Pick up your fork. That's Step 1. Great. You're in charge of Step 2: find a piece of chicken. [Narrate]. Good! Step 3: in your mouth. You did it!","Empower them by narrating the micro-steps. You are *being* their external executive function, guiding them step-by-step.","Don't expect them to 'get it' and finish. You may have to re-narrate this 2-3 times.","This is often a failure of 'task initiation' or 'task-monitoring'. They get 'stuck' or 'drift' and genuinely forget the *goal* (eating). Narrating the steps is a verbal scaffold.","They are not trying to be 'bad'. Their brain just 'changed channels'.","This keeps the meal calm and moves it forward.","Mealtime-Too Distracted to Eat|Hygiene-Distracted in Bath"

[Gentle hand on shoulder, guide back]. I need your body to come back to the chair.","Use a calm, neutral, 'robot' voice. No anger. Just a physical, gentle guide back.","Don't get angry. Don't ask 'Why?' (you'll get a 10-minute story about a speck on the floor).","Your legs are 'wiggles'. It's hard to sit for a long time. AND the rule is 'bottoms in chairs at dinner'. Let's give your 'wiggles' a job. Can your feet 'tap dance' under the chair *while* your top half eats?","Validate the *need* to move. State the rule.

Let's see you do it. Great! Now, while your feet are busy, let's get that fork busy. One bite.","Empower them by giving them control over the 'acceptable' wiggling. This 'grounds' their brain, which can *increase* focus on eating.","Don't make the 'dance' too wild. 'Quiet tap dance' or 'pushing against my feet'.","They *need* to move. Banning movement is futile and escalates the problem. *Redirecting* the movement to an acceptable channel (feet) allows their brain to get the sensory input it craves, which frees up focus.","A 'wiggle cushion' (sensory cushion) or a 'stretchy band' around the chair legs can also work.","This is a sensory need, not a behavioral problem.","Tantrums-Hyperactive/Restless|Bedtime-Distracted During Story"
