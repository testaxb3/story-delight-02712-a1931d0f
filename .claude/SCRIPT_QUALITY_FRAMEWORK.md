# Script Quality Elevation Framework
## The Anti-Generic Script Creation System

**Purpose**: Eliminate repetitive, template-filled scripts. Create hyper-specific, recognizable moments that parents experience.

---

## Pre-Creation Checklist

**MANDATORY BEFORE WRITING ANY SCRIPT:**

### 1. Micro-Observation Test
- Close your eyes and visualize the moment
- What do you SEE? (body language, facial expressions, physical actions)
- What do you HEAR? (exact phrases, tone, volume, ambient sounds)
- What does the PARENT FEEL? (heart racing, jaw clenched, stomach tight)

**Pass criteria**: You can describe the scene as if filming it with a camera.

### 2. Uniqueness Test
- Read 3 existing scripts in the same category
- Is your script 80%+ different in structure, language, and details?
- Does it capture a DISTINCT moment, not a variation of existing scripts?

**Pass criteria**: Someone could read your script and 2 others from the category and immediately tell them apart.

### 3. Parent Recognition Test
- Would a parent read the first paragraph and say "HOLY SHIT, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS"?
- Is the situation specific enough that only parents who've experienced THIS EXACT THING would recognize it?

**Pass criteria**: High specificity = high recognition. Generic = skip button.

## Writing Variability Rules

### THE SITUATION - 5 Different Structures (ROTATE THESE)

**Structure 1: Scene-Based (Cinematic)**
```
It's 7:14 AM. You've asked them to brush teeth 4 times. 
They're still in pajamas, staring at the wall, humming.
You have to leave in 6 minutes.
```

**Structure 2: Sensory-First**
```
You hear the sound before you see it: the low rumbling growl 
that means they're about to explode. Their fists are clenched. 
Their breathing is fast and shallow through their nose.
```

**Structure 3: Timeline Explosion**
```
What should take 3 minutes takes 45. Here's what happens:
Minute 1-5: They agree to start.
Minute 6-15: They "need" to find the perfect socks.
Minute 16-30: Meltdown about sock seam.
Minute 31-45: You're doing it for them while they cry.
```

**Structure 4: Parent POV**
```
You're already running late. You grab the shoes. 
Then you see their face — that blank, distant stare.
They haven't moved. They didn't hear a word you said.
Your chest tightens. Here we go again.
```

**Structure 5: Child POV**
```
From their perspective, everything was fine. 
They were building the perfect Lego tower.
Then YOU ruined it by demanding they "come eat" RIGHT NOW.
The tower will NEVER be this good again.
They're not being difficult — you destroyed their world.
```

---

### WHAT DOESN'T WORK - 3 Different Structures (ROTATE THESE)

**Structure 1: Common Mistakes + Neuroscience**
```
❌ "Just eat faster! We don't have all day!"
→ Why this backfires: The ADHD brain can't process time pressure 
when hyperfocused on texture, taste, and sensory input. Your urgency 
makes their nervous system lock up harder.

❌ "If you don't finish in 10 minutes, no dessert!"
→ Why this backfires: Threats activate the amygdala, which shuts down 
the prefrontal cortex needed to speed up. Now they're anxious AND slow.
```

**Structure 2: Parent Confession Format**
```
Most parents start with reminders: "5 more minutes!" 
When that doesn't work, they escalate: "I SAID NOW!"
When that doesn't work, they physically remove the device.

Now you have a screaming child, a broken routine, and the creeping 
feeling that you're the bad guy. This approach fails because it 
treats screen time like a negotiation instead of a neurological event.
```

**Structure 3: Escalation Sequence**
```
First you try: Calm voice, logical explanation.
That fails, so you try: Louder voice, consequence warning.
That fails, so you try: Removing privileges, time-outs.
Now it's worse because: Each escalation activates their 
defiance reflex. They're not hearing your words anymore — 
they're in pure opposition mode.
```

### STRATEGY STEPS - Language Variation

**DON'T ALWAYS USE:**
- "Your move:"
- "The shift:"
- "Do NOT:"
- "Why this works:"

**INSTEAD ROTATE BETWEEN:**
- Direct imperatives: "Say this, not that."
- Narrative instructions: "You're going to..."
- Coaching format: "Here's what you do..."
- Contrast format: "Instead of X, do Y because..."
- Question format: "What happens if you...?"

---

## Specificity Requirements

### MANDATORY IN EVERY SCRIPT

#### 1. Observable Behaviors (Not Abstract)
❌ "Child is upset"  
✅ "Fists clenched, jaw tight, breathing fast through nose, eyes darting to the door"

❌ "Child resists"  
✅ "Arches back, goes rigid, makes body heavy like a sack of concrete"

❌ "Child ignores you"  
✅ "Stares past you, humming, fingers tapping rhythm on table, eyes glazed"

#### 2. Exact Numbers/Timings
❌ "Takes a long time"  
✅ "45+ minutes for a task that should take 5"

❌ "Often happens"  
✅ "3-4 times per week, usually between 6-7 PM"

❌ "Many reminders needed"  
✅ "You've asked 7 times in 12 minutes"

#### 3. Quoted Phrases (What They ACTUALLY Say)
❌ "Child protests"  
✅ "They scream: 'You NEVER let me do ANYTHING!'"

❌ "Child makes excuses"  
✅ "They say in a calm voice: 'I was JUST about to do it. Why do you always think I'm not listening?'"

❌ "Child negotiates"  
✅ "They look you dead in the eye: 'Five more minutes. Just five. Please? I promise I'll stop then.'"

#### 4. Physical Details
❌ "They sit down"  
✅ "They slide down the wall into a heap, limbs sprawled like a puppet with cut strings"

❌ "They walk away"  
✅ "They stomp toward their room, each step an earthquake, door slams hard enough to rattle the frame"

#### 5. Parent Emotional State
❌ "Parent is frustrated"  
✅ "Your jaw is clenched. You can feel your heart racing. You're already 20 minutes late. Your boss texted twice."

❌ "Parent is tired"  
✅ "Your eyes burn. You've been up since 5 AM. You have 47 unread emails. You're holding back tears."

#### 6. Environmental Context
❌ "At bedtime"  
✅ "It's 9:47 PM. You started bedtime routine at 8:30. Lights are dim. Weighted blanket is on the bed. You've read 2 books already. They're still wired."

❌ "In the car"  
✅ "You're in the Target parking lot. AC blasting. Car in park. Other families loading groceries. Your child is screaming in the back seat. Windows up."

#### 7. CRITICAL: Proper Line Breaks in `what_doesnt_work`
⚠️ **The rendering component splits by `\n\n` (double line breaks) to separate paragraphs.**

❌ **WRONG** (single line break - text will concatenate):
```
**Why it fails:** Their brain isn't choosing to stop.\n
**The neuroscience:** ADHD brains have 30-40% less activity...
```

✅ **CORRECT** (double line break - text separates properly):
```
**Why it fails:** Their brain isn't choosing to stop.\n\n
**The neuroscience:** ADHD brains have 30-40% less activity...
```

**FORMATTING RULES:**
- Use `\n\n` (double line break) between EVERY paragraph and section
- Use `\n\n` between "Why it fails" and "The neuroscience"
- Use `\n\n\n` (triple line break) between each COMMON MISTAKE block
- Without proper line breaks, all text appears concatenated and unreadable

## Anti-Repetition Rules

### FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (Immediately Rewrite If These Appear)

❌ **Pattern 1**: "You tell your child [X]. They [Y]. You check back..."  
❌ **Pattern 2**: "Your child is deep into [activity]. You say [warning]. They nod and say 'okay!'"  
❌ **Pattern 3**: "This isn't defiance. This is [neurological explanation]."  
❌ **Pattern 4**: "By [step X], you're [teaching/providing/creating]..."  
❌ **Pattern 5**: "The [brain profile] brain [generic statement]..."  
❌ **Pattern 6**: "Here's what's really happening: [neuroscience]..."  
❌ **Pattern 7**: "Your child isn't trying to [negative action]. They're [positive reframe]."  
❌ **Pattern 8**: Starting with "It's [time]. You've [asked/told/tried] [X times]..."  
❌ **Pattern 9**: "What looks like [behavior] is actually [deeper reason]."  
❌ **Pattern 10**: Using "co-regulation", "nervous system", "dysregulation" more than once per script

### REPLACEMENT STRATEGIES

**Instead of generic neuroscience explanations:**
- Use metaphors: "Their brain is like a browser with 47 tabs open"
- Use sensory analogies: "It feels like static in their head"
- Use physical comparisons: "Their body is a spring wound too tight"

**Instead of repetitive structures:**
- Start mid-action: "The fork hits the floor. Third time."
- Start with dialogue: "'I'm NOT tired!' They're rubbing their eyes."
- Start with a sound: "The door slams. You weren't even arguing yet."
- Start with a sensation: "Your temples throb. This is the 4th battle today."

**Instead of clinical language:**
- "Their brain gets stuck" not "executive function deficit"
- "They can't unstick" not "perseveration"
- "Wired wrong for this" not "neurodivergent challenges"

## Quality Scoring System

### Self-Evaluation (MANDATORY Before Submission)

Score each dimension 0-10. **Minimum 8/10 required on ALL dimensions.**

#### 1. SPECIFICITY SCORE
- How many observable micro-details? (Count them)
- Are there exact numbers, timings, or measurements?
- Can you visualize the scene clearly from the description?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 10/10 = 8+ specific details, exact numbers, vivid visualization
- 7-9/10 = 5-7 specific details, some numbers, good visualization
- 4-6/10 = 2-4 details, vague timings, hard to visualize
- 0-3/10 = Generic, template language, no specific details

#### 2. RECOGNITION SCORE
- Would a parent say "THIS IS MY LIFE" when reading it?
- Is it specific enough that only certain parents relate?
- Does it capture the EXACT moment, not a category of moments?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 10/10 = Parent would screenshot and text to friends saying "OMG THIS"
- 7-9/10 = Parent would nod vigorously while reading
- 4-6/10 = Parent would think "yeah, kind of like that"
- 0-3/10 = Parent would skim and move on

#### 3. UNIQUENESS SCORE
- Is it 80%+ different from other scripts in the category?
- Does it use a different THE SITUATION structure than recent scripts?
- Would someone mixing up 5 scripts immediately identify this one?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 10/10 = Completely distinct scenario, structure, language
- 7-9/10 = Mostly unique with minor similarity to 1 other script
- 4-6/10 = Similar structure to 2-3 scripts but different details
- 0-3/10 = Feels like a template fill-in-the-blank

#### 4. ACTIONABILITY SCORE
- Are the strategy steps concrete and executable?
- Could a stressed parent at 7 AM follow these instructions?
- Are the "what to say" phrases realistic and natural?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 10/10 = Crystal clear, copy-paste-speak level instructions
- 7-9/10 = Clear instructions with minor interpretation needed
- 4-6/10 = Vague guidance, parent would improvise most of it
- 0-3/10 = Abstract advice, unclear how to actually do it

#### 5. NATURALNESS SCORE
- Does it sound like a human talking to another human?
- Are the phrases realistic, not therapy-speak?
- Would a parent actually say these words out loud?

**Scoring Guide:**
- 10/10 = Sounds like friend giving advice over coffee
- 7-9/10 = Sounds professional but human
- 4-6/10 = Sounds slightly clinical or scripted
- 0-3/10 = Sounds like AI-generated therapy manual

## Revision Protocol

### How to Identify Generic Scripts

**Red Flags:**
1. Starts with "It's [time]. You've [asked/told] them..."
2. Contains 3+ forbidden patterns
3. Uses "co-regulation" or "dysregulation" multiple times
4. Strategy steps all start with "Your move:" or "The shift:"
5. WHAT DOESN'T WORK section starts with "❌ [Common mistake] → Why this backfires:"
6. No exact numbers, timings, or quoted phrases
7. Could apply to multiple different scenarios
8. Parent emotional state not described
9. Environmental context missing
10. Uses abstract language like "child is upset" instead of observable behaviors

### Rewrite Process

1. **Read the generic script completely**
2. **Visualize the SPECIFIC moment** (not the category)
3. **Choose a NEW situation structure** (1-5, different from original)
4. **Add 6+ micro-details** (observable, sensory, specific)
5. **Include exact phrases** the child says
6. **Describe parent's physical/emotional state**
7. **Vary the WHAT DOESN'T WORK structure**
8. **Change strategy step language** (not always "Your move:")
9. **Run quality scoring** (must be 8+/10 on all dimensions)
10. **Compare before/after** - is it 80%+ different?

## Examples: Before/After

### BEFORE (Generic, Template-Filled)
```
THE SITUATION:
Your child is playing on their tablet. You tell them it's time to stop. 
They say "okay" but don't stop. You remind them again. They ignore you.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
❌ Yelling at them to stop → This activates their defiance
❌ Taking the tablet away → This causes a meltdown
```

**Problems:**
- No specific details
- No exact timing
- No quoted phrases
- No parent emotional state
- No environmental context
- Generic "child ignores you"
- Repetitive structure

---

### AFTER (Hyper-Specific, Quality Framework Applied)
```
THE SITUATION:
It's 4:47 PM. Your child has been on the iPad for exactly 30 minutes — 
the agreed-upon limit. You say: "Time's up, buddy. iPad goes on the charger."

They don't even look up. Their thumb keeps scrolling. TikTok dance video #247.

You move closer. You're standing right next to them now.
"Hey. Did you hear me? Timer's done."

They nod. They say "Uh-huh" without breaking eye contact with the screen.
Their thumb keeps moving. Video #248. #249. #250.

Your jaw tightens. You have dinner to make, laundry to fold, and a work 
email marked URGENT sitting in your inbox. You reach for the iPad.

That's when they finally look at you — confused, hurt, like you just 
appeared out of thin air and attacked them for no reason.

"WHAT?! I was ABOUT to turn it off! Why are you being so MEAN?!"

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
Most parents escalate at this point. First you repeat yourself louder: 
"I TOLD YOU TWICE ALREADY!" When that doesn't work, you grab the device. 
Now you're wrestling a screaming child while TikTok keeps playing in the background.

This approach fails because you're trying to interrupt a dopamine loop 
with logic. Their brain isn't ignoring you on purpose — it literally 
cannot process your words while the algorithm has their attention.
```

**Improvements:**
- Exact time (4:47 PM), exact duration (30 minutes)
- Specific app (TikTok), specific behavior (thumb scrolling)
- Quoted phrases ("Uh-huh", "WHAT?!", "Why are you being so MEAN?!")
- Parent emotional state (jaw tightens, frustration building)
- Environmental context (dinner, laundry, work email)
- Observable behaviors (nod without looking, thumb keeps moving)
- Unique structure (not starting with generic "You tell your child...")
- Natural language (sounds like a real parent describing real moment)

---

## Final Notes

**The Goal:**
Every script should feel like a parent telling another parent about something 
that happened THIS MORNING. Not a therapy manual. Not a generic parenting tip.

A real, specific, "holy shit that's my life" moment.

If it doesn't pass the Recognition Test, it doesn't ship.
If it scores below 8/10 on any dimension, it gets rewritten.
If it matches a forbidden pattern, it starts over.

**No exceptions.**
