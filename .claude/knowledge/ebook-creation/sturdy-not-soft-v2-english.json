I was very frustrated and lost control. That was my mistake. It's not your fault that I yelled.\"\n\n**3. Validate the scare:** \"It must have been scary when I raised my voice like that. I understand if you're upset with me.\"\n\n**4. Reconnect (if they want):** \"I'd love to give you a hug now if you want. If you don't want to, that's okay, I'm here when you're ready.\""
