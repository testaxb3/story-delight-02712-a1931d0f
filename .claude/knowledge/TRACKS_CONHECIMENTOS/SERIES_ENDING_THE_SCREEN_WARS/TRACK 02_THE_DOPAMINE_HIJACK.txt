[warmly] The Explosion. [long pause]
It happens exactly three seconds after the screen goes black.
[softly] You pressed the button. You braced yourself. And then...
[sighs] The scream that could shatter glass.
[gently] "I HATE YOU! YOU'RE THE WORST MOM EVER! GIVE IT BACK!"
[thoughtfully] A toy goes flying across the room. A body throws itself on the floor, thrashing like a fish out of water.
[long pause]
[softly] And in that moment, standing over a screaming child... your blood begins to boil.
[gently] You think: "I just let you watch for an hour. I gave you exactly what you wanted. And this is how you thank me?"
[whispers] "You are so ungrateful."
[short pause]
"I am raising a spoiled brat."
"Never again."
[long pause]
[reassuring] Mama... [inhales deeply] ... [exhales slowly]
Step back from the ledge. Just for a second.
[gently] I need you to know something that will change how you see this rage forever.
[softly] This is not ingratitude.
[thoughtfully] And this is not a "behavior" problem that needs a timeout.
[gently] This is a chemical hijack.
[long pause]
[curious] Let's look inside their brain for a moment.
[thoughtfully] When they are on that screen—playing that fast-paced game, watching the infinite scroll—their brain is being hijacked by dopamine.
[gently] Dopamine is the "feel good" chemical. It’s the "more, more, more" chemical.
[softly] For 60 minutes, their brain was operating at a Level 10 dopamine high.
[thoughtfully] Effortless pleasure. Constant reward. Fireworks every time they touched the glass.
[long pause]
[gently] And then... you pressed the button.
[softly] Click.
[thoughtfully] In one second, the dopamine supply was cut.
[gently] Their brain didn't just go back to normal. It plummeted.
[softly] It went from Level 10... straight down to Level Negative 5.
[long pause]
[thoughtfully] That scream? That thrashing body?
[gently] That is not a child trying to manipulate you.
[softly] That is a nervous system in freefall.
[thoughtfully] They are physically painful to be in. The world feels gray, slow, and incredibly boring compared to the screen.
[gently] It is—and I say this carefully—a mild withdrawal symptom.
[long pause]
[reassuring] Why does this matter?
[warmly] Because when you think they are being "spoiled," you get angry. You want to punish them. "Go to your room!"
[gently] But when you realize they are in a "dopamine crash"... you get curious. You become the safety net.
[softly] You don't punish a crash. You manage it.
[long pause]
[thoughtfully] So, how do we handle The Explosion without losing our minds?
[gently] We use a tool called "The Dopamine Bridge."
[warmly] We cannot stop the crash completely, but we can soften the landing.
[long pause]
[reassuring] Here is the protocol for the next time you turn it off.
[gently] Step One: The Specific Warning.
[softly] Do not say "5 more minutes." Time is abstract to a dopamine-drunk brain.
[gently] Say: "Two more videos. Then the screen goes to sleep." Or "Finish this level. Then we stop."
[long pause]
Step Two: The Physical Bridge.
[thoughtfully] This is the secret sauce.
[gently] Before you touch the off button... enter their world physically.
[softly] Sit next to them. Put a hand on their back. Watch the screen with them for 30 seconds.
[gently] "Whoa, that jump was cool. Is that the blue guy?"
[thoughtfully] You are connecting their brain to YOU before you disconnect it from the SCREEN.
[softly] You are building a bridge out of the digital world, so they don't have to jump off a cliff.
[long pause]
Step Three: The Sensory Landing.
[gently] When the screen goes off, have something *sensory* ready immediately.
[softly] Do not transition to a chore. Do not say "go brush your teeth." That requires too much willpower.
[warmly] Have a snack. Have a wrestling match. Have a glass of cold water. "Let's run to the kitchen!"
[thoughtfully] You are offering their body a tiny, natural hit of dopamine to replace the massive, artificial one they just lost.
[long pause]
[reassuring] Will they still cry?
[sighs] Probably. It still feels bad to stop.
[gently] But instead of yelling "You are ungrateful!", you can hold the boundary with calm, sturdy power.
[softly] You can say: "I know. It feels bad to stop. Your brain really loved that. I'm here."
[long pause]
[warmly] Do you feel the difference?
[thoughtfully] You are no longer the Villain taking away the fun.
[gently] You are the Pilot guiding the plane through a very turbulent landing.
[softly] It’s bumpy. It’s loud. The passengers are screaming.
[warmly] But you are flying the plane. And you are safe.
[long pause]
[softly] Take a breath. [inhales deeply]
[whispers] You are the pilot.
[exhales slowly]
[warmly] The turbulence will pass. The crash will end.
[softly] And the child will come back.
[warmly] I’ll see you in the next track.
