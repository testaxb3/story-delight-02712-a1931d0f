## The "Somatic Arc" Structure
Every track is a mini-therapy session. It moves the body from **Tension** -> **Release** -> **Action**.

### SECTION 1: THE SOMATIC HOOK (0 - 15% | ~750 chars)
**Goal:** Match their current physical state (Stress/Panic) and validate it.
1.  **The Scene:** Describe the *exact* moment of pain. Sensory details (sounds, feelings).
2.  **The Somatic Match:** "Your jaw is tight," "Your heart is racing."
3.  **The Validation:** "You are not failing. You are overwhelmed."

> *Audio Cue:* Fast paced -> Slowing down. `[warmly]`

### SECTION 2: THE "AHA" SHIFT (15 - 50% | ~1750 chars)
**Goal:** Shift the intellect. Give a new lens to view the problem.
1.  **The Old Way:** "You think they are being bad."
2.  **The Science (Simplified):** "Their brain is offline." (Use metaphors: The Guard Dog, The Upstairs Brain).
3.  **The Reframe:** "It's not an attack. It's a cry for help."

> *Audio Cue:* `[thoughtfully]` `[long pause]`

### SECTION 3: THE ONE TOOL (50 - 80% | ~1500 chars)
**Goal:** Give ONE specific, actionable thing. Not three. ONE.
1.  **The Name:** Give the tool a catchy name (e.g., "The 3-Second Pause", "The Sportscaster").
2.  **The Script:** Tell them EXACTLY what to say.
3.  **The Reality Check:** "It won't work instantly. Here is what will happen."

> *Audio Cue:* Clear, instructional but gentle. `[reassuring]`

### SECTION 4: THE SOMATIC CLOSING (80 - 100% | ~1000 chars)
**Goal:** Regulate the mother before she leaves.
1.  **The Permission:** "You don't have to be perfect."
2.  **The Breath:** A guided 15-second breath.
3.  **The Open Loop:** Tease the next step (if part of a series).

> *Audio Cue:* `[softly]` `[inhales deeply]` `[exhales]` `[whispers]`

## CRITICAL: The "Character Economy"
We have 5,000 characters. Every word must fight for its life.

**DELETE:**
*   "Welcome to this track where we will discuss..." (Garbage).
*   "It is important to remember that..." (Filler).
*   "Research by Dr. So-and-So from 1998 shows..." (Boring).
*   "I hope you enjoyed this." (Weak).

**KEEP:**
*   "Listen."
*   "This is hard."
*   "Try this."
*   "You are safe."

**The "You" Rule:**
*   Use "You" and "Your" 10x more than "I" or "We".
*   Address her as "Mama" or "My friend" (Consistent avatar).

## The "Golden Ratio" Check
Before finalizing any script, check:
*   [ ] **Hook:** Does it describe a specific scene?
*   [ ] **Science:** Is there ONE clear "Aha" moment?
*   [ ] **Tool:** Is there ONE specific script she can say?
*   [ ] **Somatic:** Did I include a breath/pause?
*   [ ] **Length:** Is it between 4,500 and 4,950 characters?
