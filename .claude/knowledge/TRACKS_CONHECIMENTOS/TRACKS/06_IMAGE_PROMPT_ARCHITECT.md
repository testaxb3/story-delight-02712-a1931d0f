# IMAGE PROMPT ARCHITECT: The "Visual Hook" System
> **OBJECTIVE:** Create visual cover art prompts that generate 100x curiosity.
> **STYLE:** Cinematic, Metaphorical, High-End 3D Editorial (Think: "Soul" meets "The New Yorker").

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Metaphor > Literal"
Never describe the literal situation. Describe the *feeling*.
*   *Boring:* "A child playing with an iPad."
*   *Premium:* "A child's face illuminated by a hypnotic electric blue glow in a dark room, looking like a digital ghost, while a warm maternal hand gently reaches in from the darkness to offer a real flower."

## 2. The Curiosity Triggers
To make a mother click, the image must trigger one of these:
*   **The Contrast:** Cold Blue Light (Screens) vs. Warm Golden Light (Connection).
*   **The Invisible Burden:** Show the "weight" she carries (e.g., a backpack made of stone labels).
*   **The Broken/Healed:** Something shattering (like a plate) but being put back together with gold (Kintsugi).

## 3. The Technical JSON Structure (Nano Banana Pro V3 Optimized)
We use JSON to force the AI to process specific lighting and texture parameters independently.

```json
{
  "subject": "[The Focal Point - e.g., The Child's Eyes]",
  "action": "[The Metaphorical Event - e.g., Breaking out of a glass box]",
  "environment": "[The Mood - e.g., A cozy room dissolving into a digital grid]",
  "art_style": {
    "medium": "3D Render, Cinematic Editorial",
    "influence": "Pixar style textures, Octane Render, Unreal Engine 5",
    "lighting": "Volumetric lighting, Chiaroscuro (high contrast), Subsurface scattering on skin"
  },
  "composition": "Center focus, Negative space at top for title, Rule of thirds",
  "color_palette": "[e.g., Electric Blue vs. Warm Honey Gold]",
  "technical_tags": [
    "aspect_ratio: 1:1 (1080x1080)",
    "8k resolution",
    "photorealistic textures",
    "depth of field",
    "raytracing",
    "masterpiece",
    "intricate details"
  ],
  "negative_prompt": "low quality, text, watermark, distorted hands, extra fingers, blurry, ugly, grainy, 2d, sketch"
}
```

## 4. How to Create a Prompt
1.  **Identify the Conflict:** What is the enemy? (Screens, Anger, Guilt).
2.  **Identify the Solution:** What is the hero? (Nature, Breath, Connection).
3.  **Collision:** Create an image where these two collide.

*"Create a JSON prompt for a cover image about [TOPIC]. The image should show [METAPHOR]. The mood is [EMOTION]. Use the Story Delight Premium Style."*
