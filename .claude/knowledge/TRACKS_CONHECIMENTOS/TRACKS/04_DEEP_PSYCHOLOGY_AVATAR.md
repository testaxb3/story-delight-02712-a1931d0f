# DEEP PSYCHOLOGY AVATAR: The "Unknowing Parent"
> **OBJECTIVE:** Understand the listener better than she understands herself.
> **USE:** Reference this when the script feels "generic".

---

## 1. The Surface Pain (What she tells friends)
*   "He won't listen to me."
*   "I'm tired of yelling."
*   "They fight all the time."
*   "I just want 5 minutes of peace."

## 2. The Secret Pain (What she thinks at 2 AM)
*   **The Fear of Damage:** "I am ruining them like my parents ruined me."
*   **The Regret:** "I love my kids, but I hate *being a mother* right now."
*   **The Disconnection:** "I look at my child and I don't feel love, I feel annoyance. Is something wrong with me?"
*   **The Comparison:** "Why does [Friend] make it look so easy? I am broken."
*   **The Rage:** "I want to run away. I fantasize about a car accident just to be in the hospital alone for a week." (Dark, but real).

## 3. The "Good Girl" Conditioning
Most of our listeners were raised to be "Good Girls".
*   They believe **Self-Sacrifice = Love**.
*   They believe **Anger = Bad**.
*   They believe **Needs = Selfishness**.
*   **The Result:** They parent from a place of *depletion* and *resentment*, then feel guilty about the resentment.

## 4. What She Craves (The Antidote)
She doesn't need more "To-Dos". She is drowning in "To-Dos".
She needs:
1.  **Permission:** To be human. To be messy. To have needs.
2.  **Reparenting:** Someone to talk to HER the way she tries to talk to her kids (Gentle, firm, loving).
3.  **Simplicity:** "Just tell me the ONE thing to do."
4.  **Co-Regulation:** She needs to borrow our nervous system because hers is fried.

| "Strict boundaries" (Feels mean) | "Sturdy leadership" (Feels safe) |
| "Consequences" (Feels punitive) | "Natural results" (Feels logical) |
| "You need to..." (Command) | "I invite you to try..." (Choice) |

## 6. The 4 Parent Archetypes (Who is listening?)

1.  **The Exploder:** Yells, then hates herself. Needs *grace* and *pause tools*.
2.  **The Imploder:** Swallows anger, gets depressed/anxious. Needs *permission to feel* and *boundaries*.
3.  **The Fixer:** Hovering, anxious, trying to prevent all tears. Needs *trust* and *resilience training*.
4.  **The Martyr:** Does everything, resents everyone. Needs *self-care* and *identity work*.

*When writing a script, aim to heal all four, but focus on the specific pain of the track.*
