# INTENSE Script Patterns - Quick Reference Guide

## Core INTENSE Brain Profile Understanding

INTENSE children experience emotions at a depth and intensity that can't be minimized. Their nervous system lacks emotional gradation - everything is experienced as either catastrophic or perfect, with no middle ground.

## Key Pattern Categories Used in Scripts

### 1. INTENSITY MATCHING (Never Minimize)

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "It's not a big deal!"
- "You're overreacting!"
- "Calm down!"
- "Stop being so dramatic!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "You are absolutely furious"
- "This feels devastating right now"
- "Your body feels terrified"
- "Being left out feels crushing"

**Why it works:** INTENSE kids KNOW their feelings are extreme. Matching the intensity validates their reality instead of making them feel gaslit.

---

### 2. EXTERNALIZING INTERNAL EXPERIENCE

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "Just think positive!"
- "Change your attitude!"
- "Stop thinking like that!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "Your brain is screaming at you"
- "Your brain is attacking you right now"
- "Your brain sees no way out"
- "Your brain won't stop racing"

**Why it works:** Externalizing the harsh inner voice helps them see thoughts as events, not facts. Creates distance from the intensity.

---

### 3. DIGNITY PRESERVATION

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "Too bad! I told you time was up!"
- "You should have finished earlier!"
- "Leave it - it doesn't matter!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "Save spot or screenshot?"
- "Take photo or plan when we return?"
- "Write tomorrow's plan or tell me one good thing?"
- "Leave it as-is or take it with you?"

**Why it works:** INTENSE kids tie their work/progress to their worth. Documentation or preservation honors their effort.

---

### 4. CONTROL OVER HOW (Not IF)

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "You don't have a choice!"
- "Do it because I said so!"
- "It's happening whether you like it or not!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "You wash or I wash gently? Happens either way, you pick how."
- "Get ready yourself or I help you? Either way, we leave at 7:45."
- "Eat now or wait until next meal? Your body, your choice."
- "You brush or I brush. Count of 3."

**Why it works:** Non-negotiable boundaries WITH autonomy over method prevents power struggles while maintaining parental authority.

---

### 5. PERFORMANCE vs. IDENTITY SEPARATION

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "One wrong answer doesn't mean anything!"
- "You're smart! You know this!"
- "It doesn't have to be perfect!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "One mistake feels like total failure" (validates the feeling)
- "You made one mistake, AND your brain says you're all bad" (separates event from identity)
- "You wanted it perfect, AND your brain is screaming at you" (externalizes perfectionism)

**Why it works:** INTENSE kids conflate performance with worth. Naming this pattern helps them see the distortion.

---

### 6. GRIEF VALIDATION FOR TRANSITIONS

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "We had plenty of time!"
- "We'll come back another day!"
- "Stop whining - it's time to go!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "Leaving feels like losing something"
- "You are absolutely devastated"
- "You were counting on this, AND it's not happening"

**Why it works:** INTENSE kids experience transitions as genuine loss/grief. Acknowledging the grief allows them to move through it instead of getting stuck.

---

### 7. PHYSICAL REGULATION BEFORE PROBLEM-SOLVING

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "Let's just talk about it!"
- "Use your words!"
- "Tell me what's wrong!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "Scream into pillow or stomp it out? Then we problem-solve."
- "Angry art or tell me everything?"
- "Melt down here or private space? Pick where, then we adjust."

**Why it works:** INTENSE brains can't access logic during emotional flooding. Physical discharge first, then cognition.

---

### 8. BINARY CHOICES (Breaking All-or-Nothing)

**Wrong Way Examples:**
- "Just do your best!"
- "Try a little bit!"
- "Make some progress!"

**INTENSE Script Pattern:**
- "One sentence or set timer for 5 minutes?"
- "Quick wipe or full wash?"
- "Brain dump notebook or calm breathing?"

**Why it works:** Vague instructions paralyze INTENSE kids. Binary choices create clear, manageable action steps.

---

## The 3-Phrase NEP Framework for INTENSE Kids

### PHRASE 1: CONNECTION (5-10 words)
**Purpose:** Match their intensity, name their reality
**Examples:**
- "Your brain won't stop racing."
- "This feels devastating right now."
- "You are absolutely furious."
- "Starting feels impossible right now."

**Don't:** Minimize, question, or challenge the feeling

---

### PHRASE 2: VALIDATION (15-20 words with AND)
**Purpose:** Acknowledge desire AND state boundary/reality
**Structure:** "You want X, AND [boundary/reality]"

**Examples:**
- "You want tomorrow to be perfect, AND your body needs sleep to make that happen."
- "You wanted to be included, AND they made a different choice."
- "You want it perfect, AND your brain is screaming at you."

**The AND is crucial:** It holds both their desire AND reality without invalidating either.

---

### PHRASE 3: COMMAND (10-15 words)
**Purpose:** Binary choice or clear action with consequence
**Structure:** "Option A or Option B? [consequence/next step]"

**Examples:**
- "Brain dump notebook or calm breathing? Pick one, I stay 5 minutes."
- "Save spot or screenshot? Then device goes on charger. You choose."
- "One tiny taste or smell it only? Then eat your safe foods."

**Key:** Limited options, clear consequence, maintains their agency

## Common INTENSE Triggers by Category

### Perfectionism Triggers
- Homework not looking "right"
- Making any mistakes
- Work being interrupted
- Time running out before completion

**Script Pattern:** Acknowledge the "impossible" standard + separate worth from work + micro-step forward

---

### Transition/Loss Triggers
- Ending fun activities
- Routine changes
- Screen time ending
- Plans being cancelled

**Script Pattern:** Name the grief/loss + validate the wanting + preserve or document + move forward

---

### Social Pain Triggers
- Not being invited
- Friend conflicts
- Perceived rejection
- Social anxiety

**Script Pattern:** "Devastating/crushing" language + acknowledge the wanting + realistic reframe + their choice on next step

---

### Autonomy Triggers
- Being told what to do
- Time pressure
- Rushed routines
- No control over outcomes

**Script Pattern:** Name the control need + non-negotiable boundary + control over HOW

## Neurological Tips - Why These Work

### 1. Amygdala Hijack
**Issue:** INTENSE kids' threat detection is hyperactive
**Solution:** Intensity matching signals safety ("They SEE how bad this is")

### 2. Prefrontal Cortex Shutdown
**Issue:** Can't access logic during flooding
**Solution:** Physical regulation first, then problem-solving

### 3. Harsh Inner Critic
**Issue:** Extreme self-judgment ties to perfectionism
**Solution:** Externalize the voice ("your brain is saying" not "you are")

### 4. Binary Thinking
**Issue:** Everything is all-or-nothing, black-and-white
**Solution:** Explicit binary choices that create action (not paralysis)

### 5. Delayed Emotional Recovery
**Issue:** Take longer to return to baseline after activation
**Solution:** Time limits, physical space, permission to fully feel

### 6. Performance = Worth Connection
**Issue:** Achievement directly tied to self-value
**Solution:** Separate the event from identity in language

## Success Indicators for INTENSE Scripts

When script is working:
- Child's body visibly softens after Phrase 1 (they feel seen)
- They engage with the choice in Phrase 3 (taking back control)
- Meltdown de-escalates within 2-10 minutes
- They can move forward after regulation

When script needs adjustment:
- Child escalates further (intensity wasn't matched enough)
- They shutdown completely (too much pressure to choose)
- They bargain/negotiate endlessly (boundary wasn't firm enough)
- Meltdown continues beyond 15 minutes (may need different regulation method)

## Parent State Requirements

INTENSE scripts require parents to be:
- **Calm:** Can't match intensity with YOUR intensity
- **Firm:** Boundaries are non-negotiable even while validating
- **Empathetic:** Genuinely believing their pain is real
- **Present:** Physically and emotionally available during regulation
- **Patient:** Not rushing through their emotional process

**If you're not in this state:** Take your own regulation break first. INTENSE kids will escalate if they sense parental dysregulation.
