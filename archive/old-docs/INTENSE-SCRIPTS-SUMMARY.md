## INTENSE Brain Profile Characteristics Addressed

All scripts are designed specifically for children with these traits:
- **Emotionally intense, deeply feeling** - Every script acknowledges the DEPTH of their emotions
- **Ties performance to self-worth** - Perfectionism scripts separate worth from outcomes
- **Experiences transitions as genuine grief/loss** - Validation of loss with preservation strategies
- **Extreme emotional reactions (0 to 100)** - No minimizing, matching their intensity level
- **Needs acknowledgment of internal experience** - "Your brain is screaming", "feels devastating"
- **All or nothing thinking** - Breaking binary thinking with micro-steps and choices

## Key INTENSE-Specific Strategies Used

1. **Intensity Matching**: Never minimizing ("You are FURIOUS", "This feels devastating")
2. **Internal Experience Naming**: Externalizing the internal voice ("your brain is screaming")
3. **Dignity Preservation**: Screenshots, documentation, saving progress
4. **Control Over HOW**: Autonomy in execution method, not outcome
5. **Genuine Validation**: Acknowledging experiences as real, not overreactions
