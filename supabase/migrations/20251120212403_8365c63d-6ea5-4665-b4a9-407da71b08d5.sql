  'You see it before you hear it: Your child is bouncing on the couch, hands flying, eyes lit up like spotlights. They''re deep into minute 40 of explaining Minecraft redstone mechanics to their friend.

Their friend is sitting cross-legged on the floor. Shoulders hunched. Eyes on the door. Giving one-word answers: "Cool." "Yeah." "Uh-huh."

Your child doesn''t notice. They''re still going: "And THEN you connect the comparator to the hopper clock, which creates a pulse that—wait, did I explain hoppers yet? Okay so hoppers are these blocks that..."

You watch their friend check an invisible watch. Shift weight. Look at you with pleading eyes that say: "Help."

Your child is THRILLED. They think this is going great. They found someone who''ll listen! They don''t see the glazed expression, the slumped posture, the micro-rejection happening in real time.

You feel it in your chest—that sinking feeling. Not again. Another playdate about to implode because your kid can''t read the room.

This is the 4th time this month.',
  
  'Most parents try interrupting from across the room: "Hey buddy, maybe let your friend have a turn talking!"

When that doesn''t work, they get more direct: "You''ve been talking about Minecraft for 40 minutes. Talk about something else."

When that doesn''t work, they rescue the situation by suggesting an activity: "Why don''t you two go play outside?"

This approach fails because it treats social blindness like a choice. Your DISTRACTED child isn''t ignoring social cues on purpose—their brain literally isn''t RECEIVING the data. They''re hyperfocused on their own interest, which creates tunnel vision. The subtle signals (body language, tone shifts, decreased engagement) don''t penetrate the hyperfocus bubble.

Telling them "read the room" is like telling a colorblind person "just see the red." The neurological equipment isn''t there.',

  '**Hyperfocus Creates Social Blindness**

When the ADHD brain locks onto a topic of interest, it''s like tunnel vision. Peripheral data (body language, facial expressions, tone changes) gets filtered out completely. It''s not selective attention—it''s involuntary neurological gating.

Your child genuinely doesn''t see the cues. Their working memory is fully occupied by the current thought stream. There''s no processing bandwidth left for social signal detection.

**External Observation Training Builds the Skill**

By physically redirecting their attention OUTWARD and narrating what you see, you''re teaching them where to look and what to look FOR.

Over time, this creates a mental checklist: "Pause. Look at friend. Check face. Check body. Check responses."

It won''t become automatic for years, but you''re installing the software.

**Concrete Scripts Reduce Cognitive Load**

"Change topics" requires:
1. Realizing you should stop
2. Thinking of a new topic
3. Executing a smooth transition

That''s three executive function tasks. Your child''s brain is already maxed out.

Giving them a word-for-word script reduces the load to one task: repeat these words. That''s manageable.',

Their friend might visibly relax once freed from the monologue prison. Your child might feel embarrassed or frustrated when they realize they missed the cues.",
    "after_week": "By attempt 5-7, they''ll start pausing on their own to check: \"Wait, am I talking too much?\" The first few self-checks will be clunky—mid-sentence interruptions, awkward pivots. That''s progress. After 2-3 weeks, they might start ASKING their friend: \"Do you want to hear more or should we play?\" That''s the breakthrough.",

  '**Energy Level Required:** Medium

You need to be present and attentive during the playdate to catch the moment before it becomes a disaster. This isn''t a "check in every 20 minutes" situation—it requires active monitoring.

**Emotional State Needed:**
• Patient but firm (your child will feel criticized even though you''re teaching)
• Comfortable with awkwardness (the intervention will pause the playdate flow)
• Observant (you need to see the friend''s discomfort BEFORE they melt down or shut down completely)

**Best Time to Try:**
• Home playdates where you can observe closely
• One-on-one playdates (easier to coach than group dynamics)
• When child isn''t already overstimulated or tired

**Don''t Try This When:**
• You''re hosting multiple kids and can''t monitor closely
• Child is at peak hyperfocus excitement (wait for a natural lull)
• You''re too exhausted to stay patient through their resistance
• At someone else''s house where you can''t control the environment',
