  the_situation = E'**The moment:** It''s 9pm. Your child is running laps, climbing, or asking for “one more thing.” **Their body is tired**, but their brain is still on high alert.\n\n**What''s really happening:** The amygdala is over-activated. The reasoning part of the brain is offline, so explanations and pressure backfire.\n\n**Goal tonight:** Guide a gentle transition from activation → regulation using environment (light + voice), sensory input, and co‑regulation — without power struggles.',
  what_doesnt_work = E'**Worsens the situation:**\n\n• Demanding “Go to bed now.”\n• Long logical explanations like “You need sleep.”\n• Threats/ultimatums or endless negotiating.\n\nWhen the nervous system is overloaded, pressure keeps the alarm high and resistance grows.',
  why_this_works = E'**Why dimming works:** The INTENSE brain has a hyperactive reticular activating system (RAS) that keeps it in “alert mode.” Dimming light signals melatonin release and reduces sensory load.\n\n**Why physical regulation works:** Many INTENSE kids seek proprioceptive input. Deep pressure, heavy work, and slow stretching activate the vagus nerve (rest-and-digest), bringing the system down.\n\n**Why choice works:** Forced compliance is read as threat, which doubles resistance. Collaborative choices restore safety and control so the prefrontal cortex can come back online.\n\n**The transition:** You aren''t fighting their energy — you''re **redirecting it into calming activities** until the body naturally winds down.'
