  what_doesnt_work = E'Forty-five minutes. That''s how long he''s been sitting in front of the same math problem.\n\nWell, "sitting" is generous. He''s spun in his chair fourteen times. Built a tower with erasers. Discovered that if you tap a pencil really fast it sounds like rain.\n\nYou''ve tried sitting next to him. He started talking about Minecraft.\n\nYou''ve tried removing distractions—he found new ones. The texture of his sleeve. A tiny scratch on the table. The sound the refrigerator makes.\n\nYou''ve tried threats. "No screens until it''s done." He said "okay" and kept tapping.\n\nYou''ve tried rewards. "Finish this and you can play." He got excited for twelve seconds, then noticed a fly on the window.\n\nIt''s not that he''s refusing. He genuinely seems to want to finish. He just... can''t make his brain do the thing. Watching him try is like watching someone push a boulder uphill while the ground keeps moving.',
  
  why_this_works = E'His brain works differently. Not worse—differently.\n\nMost brains have a secretary that files incoming information: "This is important, focus here. That''s boring, ignore it." His secretary is on permanent coffee break. Everything comes in at the same volume. The math problem. The pencil tap. The scratch. The fly. All equally demanding attention.\n\nAdding pressure doesn''t wake up the secretary. It just adds another thing competing for attention: now he''s thinking about the math AND your frustration AND the consequence AND still the fly.\n\nThis script works by reducing the cognitive load. Instead of one huge task (worksheet), tiny chunks (one problem). Instead of open-ended time (torture for this brain), specific short bursts. Instead of "focus harder" (impossible), physical movement to burn off excess energy.\n\nYou''re not lowering expectations. You''re matching the work structure to how his brain actually operates.'
