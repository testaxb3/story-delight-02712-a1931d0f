  <h2>Why Involvement in Meal Prep Matters</h2>
  <p>Kids are naturally curious and love to explore their environment, including what goes into their tummies. By involving them in the kitchen, you tap into this curiosity. They learn about different ingredients, textures, and tastes, and are more likely to try foods they''ve had a hand in making.</p>
  <p>Participating in meal prep also gives children a sense of control and accomplishment, which can be particularly motivating for toddlers asserting their independence.</p>
