  E'2:14 PM. Grandma''s driveway. The car is parked. Everyone else is unbuckled.\n\nYour 5-year-old is RIGID in their car seat. Fists clenched. Face red. Feet kicking against the seat in front of them - thump, thump, thump.\n\n"NO! I don''t WANT to go to Grandma''s! I want to go HOME!"\n\nThe weird part? They LOVE Grandma. They asked about this visit yesterday. But right now, in this moment, the idea of transitioning from car to house is apparently unbearable.\n\nGrandma is at the front door, waving uncertainly. Your neighbor is pretending to check their mailbox while obviously watching. Your other kid is already halfway up the sidewalk, embarrassed.\n\n"I''m NOT GETTING OUT! YOU CAN''T MAKE ME!"\n\nThe kicking intensifies. They''re starting to sweat. Their voice is getting that high, desperate pitch that means we''re heading toward full meltdown territory.\n\nYou look at the car seat buckle. You could physically extract them. But you''ve done that before and it took 45 minutes for everyone to recover.',
  
  E'**❌ COMMON MISTAKE #1: The Logic Reminder**\n\n"But you LOVE Grandma! You were excited this morning! This doesn''t make any sense!"\n\nYou''re right - it doesn''t make logical sense. But INTENSE children don''t transition based on logic. Their nervous system is FLOODED. Logic is offline.\n\n\n**❌ COMMON MISTAKE #2: The Countdown Threat**\n\n"You have until the count of three to get out of this car..."\n\nCountdowns increase pressure, which increases their nervous system activation. You''re adding fuel to the fire. Also: what happens at three? Physical extraction creates trauma for everyone.\n\n\n**❌ COMMON MISTAKE #3: The Audience Appeal**\n\n"Grandma is waiting. The neighbors are watching. Don''t you want people to think you''re a big kid?"\n\nINTENSE children in meltdown mode cannot process social awareness. Their brain is in survival mode, not social mode. You just added shame to overwhelm.',

  E'INTENSE children experience transitions as **neurological earthquakes**. Their brains are processing the current state deeply, and switching states requires massive neural reorganization.\n\nThis is related to **state-dependent memory**: in the car, they''re in "car mode." Everything about Grandma''s house exists in a different mental state. Crossing between states feels like jumping across a canyon.\n\nThe kicking and rigidity is their nervous system''s **freeze response** mixed with **fight response**. They''re not being defiant - they''re STUCK. Their body is trying to discharge the overwhelming energy of the transition demand.\n\n**Bridges work** because they create intermediate states. Instead of Car → Grandma''s House (huge gap), it becomes Car → Open Door → Feel Air → Step Out → Porch → Door → Inside (tiny steps their brain can actually process).',
