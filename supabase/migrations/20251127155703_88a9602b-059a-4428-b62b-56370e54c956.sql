  E'Aisle 7. Pet supplies. You turn around to compare dog food prices for literally 8 seconds.\n\nGone.\n\nYour 7-year-old has vanished. Again. This is the third time THIS MONTH.\n\n"Emma? EMMA?"\n\nYour heart is already pounding. You abandon the cart and start the search pattern you''ve memorized: toys first, then electronics, then the dollar spot.\n\n15 minutes later, you find her in the toy section. Not panicked. Not looking for you. Completely absorbed in a display of fidget toys, methodically testing each one with the focus of a scientist conducting critical research.\n\nShe doesn''t even notice you approaching. "EMMA!" She jumps. Blinks. "Oh. Hi Mom. Look at this one - it has sixteen different textures!"',
  E'**❌ COMMON MISTAKE #1: The Fear Lecture**\n\n"Do you know what could have HAPPENED?"\n\nShe genuinely doesn''t connect wandering to danger. Her brain was solving the fidget toy puzzle, not planning an escape.\n\n\n**❌ COMMON MISTAKE #2: The Punishment Threat**\n\n"You''re never coming to Target again!"\n\nShe''ll forget why. The underlying issue wasn''t addressed.\n\n\n**❌ COMMON MISTAKE #3: The Guilt Trip**\n\n"How could you do that to me?"\n\nShe didn''t DO anything TO you. She followed an interesting thought and lost track.',

  E'DISTRACTED brains have a novelty-detection system that''s extremely sensitive. New stimuli literally hijack attention.\n\nThis is hyperfocus tunneling: peripheral awareness SHUTS DOWN.
