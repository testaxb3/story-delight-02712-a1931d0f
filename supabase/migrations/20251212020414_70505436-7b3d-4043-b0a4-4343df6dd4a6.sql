  'Managing Power Struggles',
  'One of the most common challenges parents face during mealtime is the power struggle that erupts when toddlers refuse to eat or demand control over what''s on their plate. These moments can be stressful for both parent and child, turning what should be a peaceful time into a battlefield. However, power struggles are a normal part of a toddler''s development as they explore their independence. The good news? There are effective ways to manage these situations and foster cooperation at the dinner table.',
