-- Fix what_doesnt_work formatting for DEFIANT Hygiene script
UPDATE scripts
SET what_doesnt_work = $$❌ **"You HAVE to take a bath right now! Go!"**
→ Demanding compliance: Triggers their defiance reflex—they HAVE to resist to maintain autonomy

❌ **"Fine! Don't bathe! See if I care when kids say you smell!"**
→ Giving up completely: They learn resistance = winning, hygiene becomes optional

❌ **"If you don't get in the bath, no screen time for a week!"**
→ Threats/future punishments: Doesn't work in the moment, damages relationship over basic hygiene

❌ **"I'm done fighting about this! You're going in whether you like it or not!"**
→ Physical force: Creates trauma around bathing, makes future baths even harder

❌ **Bribing with treats every single time ("Bath = dessert!")**
→ Constant bribing: Teaches they should get rewarded for basic self-care, unsustainable

**Why these backfire:** The DEFIANT brain interprets hygiene demands as loss of control. You're making bathing about compliance rather than choice, which triggers automatic resistance.$$
